This wiki page serves to act as a reference for most of the technical aspects of the `Terraria.Player::Update(int)` method.  
If you want a full reference, decompile tModLoader via the `setup.bat` tool (see: [tModLoader guide for contributors](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/tModLoader-guide-for-contributors)).

The update "tasks" are listed in logical order, using numbered lists to indicate relevance.

                * `Player::maFallSpeed` is reduced to `2`
        1. Otherwise:
            * `Player::gravity` is reduced to `0.2`
            * `Player::maxFallSpeed` is reduced to `5`
            * `Player::jumpHeight` is increased to `30`
            * `Player::jumpSpeed` is increased to `6.01`
1. If the player has the Distorted debuff:
    * `Player::gravity` is set to `0`
1. `Player::maxFallSpeed` is incremented by `0.01`
1. If the player is this game's client (`Main.myPlayer == i`)...
    1. The quick-grapple timer for gamepads is handled
    1. The preview shown before placing a tile is reset (`TileObject.objectPreview.Reset()`)
    1. `Player::downedDD2EventAnyDifficulty` (a variable used to track if the player can use DD2 sentries outside of the event) is set if `DD2Event::DownedInvasionAnyDifficulty` is set
1. `NPC::freeCake` handling
    * Player receives a Slice of Cake from the Party Girl if they talk to her during a naturally-occurring party
1. The `Player::emoteTime` timer is decremented

    * Otherwise, if `Player::lifeSteal` is less than `70`, it is incremented by `0.5`.  It is then capped at `70`
1. `Player::ResizeHitbox()` is invoked
    * [Explanation](#playerresizehitbox)
1. If the player is on a mount and that mount is the Rudolph mount (Reindeer Bells), light is spawned on the player's center
1. Other Client Checking
    1. `Player::outOfRange` is cleared
    1. If the player is not this game's client (`whoAmI != Main.myPlayer`) and they're outside of the world bounds, `Player::outOfRange` is set
        * NOTE: due to `Terraria.Tile` becoming a struct in 1.4 tModLoader, the additional checks for if the player is an unloaded world section fail.
    1. If the player is considered "out of range":
        * `Player::numMinions`, `Player::slotsMinions` and `Player::itemAnimation` are set to `0`
        * `Player::UpdateBuffs(int)` is invoked

### LockOnHelper::Update()
The lock-on system is a hidden mechanic in Terraria that's usually gatekept behind gamepad usage.  
Activating the system and selecting a target NPC causes the effective cursor location to be snapped onto the target NPC's center for weapon aiming purposes.

This method handles checking if the system can be used, updating timers for the arrow visuals and finding valid targets.

### DontStarveDarknessDamageDealer::Update(Player)
While in complete darkness for at least 5 seconds, the player starts receiving 50 damage every second.

In order to be considered "in darkness", the following is evaluated:
1. Retrieve the light value at the player's center
1. Convert the light value into a 3D vector, where the range of each component is between `0` and `1`, inclusive.  For comparison, a color value of `255` is converted into `1`
1. If the length of that vector is less than `0.15`, then the player is considered "not safe", aka in darkness.

### Player::ResizeHitbox()
This method updates the player's Y-position to account for `Player::HeightOffsetBoost`, a property that either uses `Mount::HeightBoost` if the player is on a mount or `PortableStoolUsage::HeightBoost` if the player is on a Step Stool, or `0` if neither are the case.

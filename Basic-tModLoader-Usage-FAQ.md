# Installation
### The following files were missing and could not be installed:.....

Solution: You didn't unzip the files prior to installation. Don't know how to unzip? -> [Google](http://www.google.com)

### System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL'CSteamworks'.....

Solution: You didn't run the installer, or you are trying to run tModLoader from somewhere other than the Steam Terraria Install directory. Or, you have the GOG version and you downloaded the wrong file.

# Load Mod
### "Failed to resolve assembly: 'Terraria, Version=1.3.5.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'"
This seems to happen when users rename the tModLoader exe to something other than Terraria.exe. Rename it back to Terraria.exe and it should still work.

### "A Mod is crashing when I try to open tModLoader"
Open up the tModLoader save directory and delete the offending .tmod file: `%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mods` (Windows)

# Players/Worlds
### "HELP, all my players and worlds are gone!"
tModLoader saves are kept separate from vanilla Terraria saves. You can copy back and forth between save locations, but be aware that you will lose Modded Tile and Items if you use tModloader worlds/characters in vanilla.
Solutions: Copy from `%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria` to `Documents\My Games\Terraria\Modding` (Windows)

# Mod Browser
### "Mod Browser Offline", "I can't download mods"

If you are on Mac or Linux, the Mod Browser doesn't work yet.  
Otherwise, the Mod Browser is out of bandwidth. Visit Mod Homepages for alternate download. DO NOT post in the forums asking when the Mod Browser will be back, it's annoying and useless.

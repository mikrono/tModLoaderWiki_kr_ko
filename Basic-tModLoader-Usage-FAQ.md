Solution: You didn't run the installer, or you are trying to run tModLoader from somewhere other than the Steam Terraria Install directory. Or, you have the GOG version and you downloaded the wrong file.

# Load Mod
### "A Mod is crashing when I try to open tModLoader"
Open up the tModLoader save directory and delete the offending .tmod file: `Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mods`

# Mod Browser
### "Mod Browser Offline", "I can't download mods"
If you are on Mac or Linux, the Mod Browser doesn't work yet.  
Otherwise, the Mod Browser is out of bandwidth. Visit Mod Homepages for alternate download. DO NOT post in the forums asking when the Mod Browser will be back, it's annoying and useless.

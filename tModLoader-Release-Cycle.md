tModLoader currently has releases mirroring Terraria 1.3 and Terraria 1.4 content. The 1.3 version will not receive any major updates and the 1.4 version is updated nightly and monthly, depending on which steam branch the user is using.

# 1.4 Alpha
1.4 tModLoader is currently in Alpha status. This means that the code changes very rapidly and that backwards compatibility with earlier alpha releases is not guaranteed. 

## Release Cycle

## 1.4-Stable

## 1.4-Preview
These [changes](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/compare/1.4-stable...1.4) will be brought into 1.4-Stable at the start of the month.

# 1.3
1.3 tModLoader is currently in maintenance mode as all of our efforts are focused on 1.4 tModLoader. If Terraria updates, 1.3 tModLoader will be updated to account for new version checks to keep the game working, but no major efforts are being put into 1.3 tModLoader.

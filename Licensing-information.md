# Primer about licenses
When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. 
Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify the work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. 
Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.
Even in the absence of a license file, you may grant some rights in cases where you publish your source code to a site that requires accepting terms of service. 
For example, if you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub (like tModLoader), you have accepted the Terms of Service, by which you allow others to view and fork your repository. ([read more](https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository#disclaimer))
Others may not need your permission if limitations and exceptions to copyright apply to their particular situation. 
Neither site terms nor jurisdiction-specific copyright limitations are sufficient for the kinds of collaboration that people usually seek on a public code host, such as experimentation, modification, and sharing as fostered by an open source license. A shorthand definition of license is "a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee". That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wants to do so

# About copyright
Copyright is a legal right, existing in many countries, that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others.
This is usually only for a limited time. 
The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use. 
A major limitation on copyright on ideas is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.

# About trademarks and patents
Copyright **is not** the same as a patent or trademark.
Copyright protects original works of authorship created by you. 
A patent protects inventions and useful discoveries. 
Trademark protects distinctive words, phrases, symbols, sounds and designs.
Trademarks identify and distinguish the source of the goods (and services) of one party from those of another party.

# About tModLoader's license
tML uses the [GNU Affero General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) (GNU AGPLv3). The GNU Affero General Public License is based on the GNU GPL, but has an additional term to allow users who interact with the licensed software over a network to receive the source for that program. It general a license sets certain permissions, conditions and limitations for the licensee. Most importantly our license permits: (includes the following, but not limited to)
- Distribution of our software
- Modification of our software

These two permissions allow others to take our software, edit it and redistribute it elsewhere if they want so. This is important to us, as it will allow people to edit tML in any way they want be it for their own benefit or the improvement of our API for the general public.

The license also sets a few important conditions: (includes the following, but not limited to)
- Source code must be disclosed
- Our license and copyright notice must be included
- Users who interact with the software via network are given the right to receive a copy of the source code

Each condition is important to us. We want people to be able to modify our program, but we don't want them to hide it. Their code must be disclosed just like ours. It must also include the license we use and our copyright notice, to ensure things remain abundantly clear even in modifications of our software. The last bullet is important to modding service provider. Consider a company that allows people to buy (pay for) their own modded server using their service. They may use a modified client/server. Our license states the condition that such company must disclose their source when asked, even though it is accessed over network use.

The license contains two liabilities, which are common in many licenses:
- Limitation of liability
- Software warranty

The gist is that "we" and our software are not liable for any damages caused by using our sofware. (See section 16 of the license). There is also no warranty for our software, which means there is no guarantee our software works as intended. (See also section 15 of the license)

# How to license your mod(s)
To license your own mod isn't very difficult. If you take things very seriously, you can consult a professional and setup your own license. It is however recommended, to take a good look at existing licenses that cover the points that you want. You can use a website such as [https://choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com) to help you find and choose one. The most common licenses are the MIT License, Apache License, and GNU License (but there are many more licenses).

Including a license on Github (and many other distribution platforms) is easy. On Github, people will usually include a file called "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.txt" in the root of their project. Github will also attempt to automatically detect your license by checking for this file. Simply include the contents of the license you want in such file, and your repository site now includes that license.

**Please note** that you cannot stop others from viewing (unless you make your project private) or forking your repository. If you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub, according to the [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-terms-of-service), other GitHub users have the right to view and fork your repository within the GitHub site. If you have already created a public repository and no longer want users to have access to it, you can make your repository private. When you convert a public repository to a private repository, existing forks or local copies created by other users will still exist. For more information, see ["Making a public repository private."](https://help.github.com/en/articles/making-a-public-repository-private) (see also: [Licensing a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository))

# Not using a license ("license free") or using the "Unlicense"
You are not under obligation to use a license. As stated before, the default copyright laws apply, so you retain all rights to the work of your project and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. (Except for viewing and forking your project on the Github website, as stated by the ToS, that is only if you use Github. Please consult the Terms of Service of the distribution platform you use to inform yourself). Not using a license is called software that is "license free". License-free software is computer software that is not explicitly in the public domain, but the software owner has not made explicit the terms of the license which makes the software fully copyright protected according to the Berne convention. (see also: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License-free_software))

If you do not care much, not using a license is fine, but it is advised to make an informed decision for choosing a license.

Using the unlicense is another popular option if you want to [disclaim copyright monopoly interest](https://cr.yp.to/publicdomain.html). You can do so easily by licensing your work under [the "Unlicense"](https://unlicense.org/).

# Copyright infringement
Someone may have infringed your copyright, and may be held liable for not abiding to the terms of your license. There is only so much we can do as a non-professional, hobbyist modding team. We own the in-house Mod Browser. What we can offer you is a takedown of the copied mod in question if you can provide proof, but we have no jurisdiction on other platforms such as Github. We also cannot offer you legal advise. If it is of importance, you are advised to consult a professional. If you want to contact us, your best bet is by contacting us on Github or through our [discord server](https://tmodloader.net/discord) (this will require a DiscordApp account)

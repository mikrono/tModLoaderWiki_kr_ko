# ModItem

This class serves as a place for you to place all your properties and hooks for each item. Create instances of ModItem (preferably overriding this class) to pass as parameters to Mod.AddItem.

## Properties

### public Item item

The item object that this ModItem controls.

### public Mod mod

The mod that added this ModItem.

### public virtual bool CloneNewInstances

Whether instances of this ModItem are created through its Clone hook or its constructor. Defaults to false.

## Fields

### public bool projOnSwing

Setting this to true makes it so that this weapon can shoot projectiles only at the beginning of its animation. Set this to true if you want a sword and its projectile creation to be in sync (for example, the Terra Blade). Defaults to false.

### public int bossBagNPC

The type of NPC that drops this boss bag. Used to determine how many coins this boss bag contains. Defaults to 0, which means this isn't a boss bag.

## Methods

### public void AddTooltip(string tooltip)

Adds a line of text to this item's first group of tooltips.

### public void AddTooltip2(string tooltip)

Adds a line of text to this item's second group of tooltips.

### public virtual bool Autoload(ref string name, ref string texture, IList\<EquipType\> equips)

Allows you to automatically load an item instead of using Mod.AddItem. Return true to allow autoloading; by default returns the mod's autoload property. Name is initialized to the overriding class name, texture is initialized to the namespace and overriding class name with periods replaced with slashes, and equip is initialized to an empty list. Use this method to either force or stop an autoload, change the default display name and texture path, and to allow for autoloading equipment textures.

### public virtual void AutoloadEquip(EquipType equip, ref string texture, ref string armTexture, ref string femaleTexture)

This method is called when Autoload adds an equipment type. This allows you to specify equipment texture paths that differ from the defaults. Texture will be initialized to the item texture followed by an underscore and equip.ToString(), armTexture will be initialized to the item texture followed by "_Arms", and femaleTexture will be initialized to the item texture followed by "_FemaleBody".

### public virtual void AutoloadFlame(ref string texture)

Allows you to specify a texture path to the flame texture for this item when it is autoloaded. The flame texture is used when the player is holding this item and its "flame" field is set to true. At the moment torches are the only use of flame textures. By default the parameter will be set to the item texture followed by "_Flame". If the texture does not exist, then this item will not be given a flame texture.

### public virtual DrawAnimation GetAnimation()

Override this method to create an animation for your item. In general you will return a new Terraria.DataStructures.DrawAnimationVertical(int frameDuration, int frameCount).

### public virtual void SetDefaults()

This is where you set all your item's properties, such as width, damage, shootSpeed, defense, etc. For those that are familiar with tAPI, this has the same function as .json files.

### public virtual bool CanUseItem(Player player)

Returns whether or not this item can be used. By default returns true.

### public virtual void UseStyle(Player player)

Allows you to modify the location and rotation of this item in its use animation.

### public virtual void HoldStyle(Player player)

Allows you to modify the location and rotation of this item when the player is holding it.

Allows you to make things happen when the player is holding this item (for example, torches make light and water candles increase spawn rate).

### public virtual void GetWeaponDamage(Player player, ref int damage)

Allows you to temporarily modify this weapon's damage based on player buffs, etc. This is useful for creating new classes of damage, or for making subclasses of damage (for example, Shroomite armor set boosts).

### public virtual void GetWeaponKnockback(Player player, ref float knockback)

Allows you to temporarily modify this weapon's knockback based on player buffs, etc. This allows you to customize knockback beyond the Player class's limited fields.

### public virtual bool ConsumeAmmo(Player player)

Whether or not ammo will be consumed upon usage. Called both by the gun and by the ammo; if at least one returns false then the ammo will not be used. By default returns true.

### public virtual bool Shoot(Player player, ref Vector2 position, ref float speedX, ref float speedY, ref int type, ref int damage, ref float knockBack)

This is called before the weapon creates a projectile. You can use it to create special effects, such as changing the speed, changing the initial position, and/or firing multiple projectiles. Return false to stop the game from shooting the default projectile (do this if you manually spawn your own projectile). Returns true by default.

### public virtual void UseItemHitbox(Player player, ref Rectangle hitbox, ref bool noHitbox)

Allows you to give this melee weapon special effects, such as creating light or dust.

### public virtual bool? CanHitNPC(Player player, NPC target)

Allows you to determine whether this melee weapon can hit the given NPC when swung. Return true to allow hitting the target, return false to block this weapon from hitting the target, and return null to use the vanilla code for whether the target can be hit. Returns null by default.

### public virtual void ModifyHitNPC(Player player, NPC target, ref int damage, ref float knockBack, ref bool crit)

### public virtual void ModifyHitPvp(Player player, Player target, ref int damage, ref bool crit)

Allows you to modify the damage, etc., that this melee weapon does to a player.

### public virtual void OnHitPvp(Player player, Player target, int damage, bool crit)

Allows you to create special effects when this melee weapon hits a player.

### public virtual bool UseItem(Player player)

Allows you to make things happen when this item is used. Return true if using this item actually does stuff. Returns false by default.

If this item is consumable and this returns true, then this item will be consumed upon usage. Returns true by default.

### public virtual bool UseItemFrame(Player player)

Allows you to modify the player's animation when this item is being used. Return true if you modify the player's animation. Returns false by default.

### public virtual void UpdateInventory(Player player)

Allows you to make things happen when this item is in the player's inventory (for example, how the cell phone makes information display).

### public virtual void UpdateEquip(Player player)

Allows you to give effects to this armor or accessory, such as increased damage.

### public virtual void UpdateAccessory(Player player, bool hideVisual)

Allows you to give effects to this accessory. The hideVisual parameter is whether the player has marked the accessory slot to be hidden from being drawn on the player.

### public virtual void UpdateVanity(Player player, EquipType type)

Allows you to create special effects (such as dust) when this item's equipment texture of the given equipment type is displayed on the player. Note that this hook is only ever called through this item's associated equipment texture.

### public virtual bool IsArmorSet(Item head, Item body, Item legs)

Returns whether or not the head armor, body armor, and leg armor make up a set. If this returns true, then this item's UpdateArmorSet method will be called. Returns false by default.

### public virtual void UpdateArmorSet(Player player)

Allows you to give set bonuses to the armor set that this armor is in.

### public virtual bool IsVanitySet(int head, int body, int legs)

Returns whether or not the head armor, body armor, and leg armor textures make up a set. This hook is used for the PreUpdateVanitySet, UpdateVanitySet, and ArmorSetShadow hooks. By default, this will return the same value as the IsArmorSet hook (passing the equipment textures' associated items as parameters), so you will not have to use this hook unless you want vanity effects to be entirely separate from armor sets. Note that this hook is only ever called through this item's associated equipment texture.

### public virtual void PreUpdateVanitySet(Player player)

Allows you to create special effects (such as the necro armor's hurt noise) when the player wears this item's vanity set. This hook is called regardless of whether the player is frozen in any way. Note that this hook is only ever called through this item's associated equipment texture.

### public virtual void UpdateVanitySet(Player player)

Allows you to create special effects (such as dust) when the player wears this item's vanity set. This hook will only be called if the player is not frozen in any way. Note that this hook is only ever called through this item's associated equipment texture.

### public virtual void ArmorSetShadows(Player player)

Allows you to determine special visual effects this vanity set has on the player without having to code them yourself. Note that this hook is only ever called through this item's associated equipment texture.

### public virtual void SetMatch(bool male, ref int equipSlot, ref bool robes)

Allows you to modify the equipment that the player appears to be wearing. This hook will only be called for body armor and leg armor. Note that equipSlot is *not* the same as the item type of the armor the player will appear to be wearing. Worn equipment has a separate set of IDs. You can find the vanilla equipment IDs by looking at the headSlot, bodySlot, and legSlot fields for items, and modded equipment IDs by looking at EquipLoader.   
If this hook is called on body armor, equipSlot allows you to modify the leg armor the player appears to be wearing. If you modify it, make sure to set robes to true. If this hook is called on leg armor, equipSlot allows you to modify the leg armor the player appears to be wearing, and the robes parameter is useless.   
Note that this hook is only ever called through this item's associated equipment texture.

### public virtual bool CanRightClick()

Returns whether or not this item does something when it is right-clicked in the inventory. Returns false by default.

### public virtual void RightClick(Player player)

Allows you to make things happen when this item is right-clicked in the inventory. Useful for goodie bags.

### public virtual void OpenBossBag(Player player)

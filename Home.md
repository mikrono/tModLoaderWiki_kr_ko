#  Please be reminded that we are currently migrating to **[a new documentation](http://bluemagic123.github.io/tModLoader/html/annotated.html)** which is much more powerful. In the future, the wiki will be used for things that can't be documented in source-code.

Welcome to the tModLoader wiki!  
This place serves as a documentation of the public members of the classes in Terraria.ModLoader.

Note that this documentation will usually be ahead of the current released version. There is no guarantee that everything here will be present in the current released version.

You can navigate through the pages through the links in one of the sidebars on the right.

If you have suggestions, tips, or have found things such as spelling errors or grammar mistakes, please notify us in **[our discord server](http://discord.me/tmodloader)**, **[the forum thead](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/1-3-tmodloader-a-modding-api.23726/)** or **[open an issue thread](https://github.com/bluemagic123/tModLoader/issues/new)** to suggest a change.

# ModTile

This class represents a _type_ of tile that can be added by a mod. Only one instance of this class will ever exist for each type of tile that is added. Any hooks that are called will be called by the instance corresponding to the tile type. This is to prevent the game from using a massive amount of memory storing tile instances.

## Properties

### public Mod mod

The mod which has added this type of ModTile.

### public string Name

The name of this type of tile.

### public ushort Type

The internal ID of this type of tile.

## Fields

These fields can be set from the SetDefaults method.

### public int soundType

The default type of sound made when this tile is hit. Defaults to 0.

### public int soundStyle

The default style of sound made when this tile is hit. Defaults to 1.

### public int dustType

The default type of dust made when this tile is hit. Defaults to 0.

### public int drop

The default type of item dropped when this tile is killed. Defaults to 0, which means no item.

### public int animationFrameHeight

The height of a group of animation frames for this tile. Defaults to 0, which disables animations.

### public Color? mapColor

The color this tile will display in on the map by default. Set to null to use the background color on the map. This field defaults to null.

### public string mapName

The display name of this tile for maps, crafting recipes, etc. Leave as an empty string to display no name (most terrain blocks do this). Defaults to the empty string.

### public float mineResist

A multiplier describing how much this block resists harvesting. Higher values will make it take longer to harvest. Defaults to 1f.

### public int minPick

The minimum pickaxe power required for pickaxes to mine this block. Defaults to 0.

### public int[] adjTiles

An array of the IDs of tiles that this tile can be considered as when looking for crafting stations.

## Methods

### public void AddToArray(ref int[] array)

A convenient method for adding this tile's Type to the given array. This can be used with the arrays in TileID.Sets.RoomNeeds.

### public virtual bool Autoload(ref string name, ref string texture)

Allows you to modify the name and texture path of this tile when it is autoloaded. Return true to autoload this tile. When a tile is autoloaded, that means you do not need to manually call Mod.AddTile. By default returns the mod's autoload property.

### public virtual void SetDefaults()

Allows you to set the properties of this tile. Many properties are stored as arrays throughout Terraria's code.

### public virtual bool KillSound(int i, int j)

Allows you to customize which sound you want to play when the tile at the given coordinates is hit. Return false to stop the game from playing its default sound for the tile. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void NumDust(int i, int j, bool fail, ref int num)

Allows you to change how many dust particles are created when the tile at the given coordinates is hit.

### public virtual bool CreateDust(int i, int j, ref int type)

Allows you to modify the default type of dust created when the tile at the given coordinates is hit. Return false to stop the default dust (the type parameter) from being created. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void DropCritterChance(int i, int j, ref int wormChance, ref int grassHopperChance, ref int jungleGrubChance)

Allows you to modify the chance the tile at the given coordinates has of spawning a certain critter when the tile is killed.

### public virtual bool Drop(int i, int j)

Allows you to customize which items the tile at the given coordinates drops. Return false to stop the game from dropping the tile's default item. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void KillTile(int i, int j, ref bool fail, ref bool effectOnly, ref bool noItem)

Allows you to determine what happens when the tile at the given coordinates is killed or hit with a pickaxe. Fail determines whether the tile is mined, effectOnly makes it so that only dust is created, and noItem stops items from dropping.

### public virtual void KillMultiTile(int i, int j, int frameX, int frameY)

This hook is called exactly once whenever a block encompassing multiple tiles is destroyed. You can use it to make your multi-tile block drop a single item, for example.

### public virtual void ModifyLight(int i, int j, ref float r, ref float g, ref float b)

Allows you to determine how much light this block emits. Make sure you set Main.tileLighted[Type] to true in SetDefaults for this to work.

### public virtual void SetSpriteEffects(int i, int j, ref SpriteEffects spriteEffects)

Allows you to determine whether or not the tile will draw itself flipped in the world.

### public virtual void AnimateTile(ref int frame, ref int frameCounter)

Allows you to animate your tile. Use frameCounter to keep track of how long the current frame has been active, and use frame to change the current frame.

### public virtual bool PreDraw(int i, int j, SpriteBatch spriteBatch)

Allows you to draw things behind the tile at the given coordinates. Return false to stop the game from drawing the tile normally. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void PostDraw(int i, int j, SpriteBatch spriteBatch)

Allows you to draw things in front of the tile at the given coordinates. This can also be used to do things such as creating dust.

### public virtual Color? MapColor(int i, int j)

Allows you to customize this tile's map color based on the state of the tile at the given coordinates. See the mapColor field for more information. Returns the mapColor field by default.

### public virtual string MapName(int frameX, int frameY)

Allows you to customize this tile's display name based on its subtype as given by its display frames. See the mapName field for more information. Returns the mapName field by default.

### public virtual void RandomUpdate(int i, int j)

Called whenever the world randomly decides to update this tile in a given tick. Useful for things such as growing or spreading.

### public virtual bool TileFrame(int i, int j, ref bool resetFrame, ref bool noBreak)

Called whenever this tile updates due to being placed or being next to a tile that is changed. Return false to stop the game from carrying out its default TileFrame operations. Returns true by default.

### public virtual bool CanPlace(int i, int j)

Allows you to stop this tile from being placed at the given coordinates. Return false to block the tile from being placed. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void RightClick(int i, int j)

Allows you to make something happen when this tile is right-clicked by the player.

### public virtual void MouseOver(int i, int j, int type)

Allows you to make something happen when the mouse hovers over this tile. Useful for showing item icons or text on the mouse.

### public virtual void HitWire(int i, int j)

Allows you to make something happen when a wire current passes through this tile.

### public virtual bool Slope(int i, int j, int type)

Allows you to control how hammers slope this tile. Return true to allow it to slope normally. Returns true by default.

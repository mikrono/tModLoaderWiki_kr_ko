## About
You can create a build.txt file in the top level of your mod's source
directory to give it build properties. These properties are used during the building process of your mod and include information about the mod. Properties in this file may remind you of .ini files, where every key has a _name_ and _value_, delimited by an equals (`=`) sign.

```.ini
property = value
otherProperty = value1, value2, value3
```
**Note: Capitalization matters in this file! Bad capitalization will lead to errors during the build process.**

White spaces do not matter. However, each property must be
on its own line, list items must be separated by commas, and property
names must be on the left side of the equals sign.

## Available properties

| dllReferences   | A list of dll references the mod has. <br> Name references by their file name without the extension. <br>You must place the dll files in a `lib/` folder in the top level of your mod source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| weakReferences  | A list of mods that the mod will build against and can natively interact with, but don't necessarily have to be enabled. Basically optional modReferences, but require the modder to be a little more careful in programming to avoid binding errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| noCompile       | Whether the mod should compile source code when being built or use .dll files pre-compiled by the mod maker. By default this will be false if you do not include this property. If this is set to true, make sure to name your mod file "All.dll" if it does not use Microsoft.Xna.Framework. If it does use Microsoft.Xna.Framework, you will need two dll files: "Windows.dll" must reference Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll and the Windows version of Terraria.exe, while "Mono.dll" must reference FNA.dll and a non-Windows version of Terraria.exe. | false
| homepage        | A link to the home website of the mod.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| hideCode        | If true, the unpacked mod that results from using the extract mod option will not include .dll files (compiled code) or .cs files (source code). | false                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| hideResources   | If true, the unpacked mod that results from using the extract mod option will not include resource files, such as .png files and .wav files. Use this if you would like to have your sounds and images freely available to other modders. Note that this does not apply to .dll or .cs files (use hideCode and includeSource). | false                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| includeSource   | If true, the unpacked mod that results from using the extract mod option will include .cs files. Use this if you would like to share your code freely (make sure to set hideCode to false). | false                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| buildIgnore     | A list of file patterns to ignore during the build process. <br> *If source is excluded (includeSource=false) | `build.txt, .gitattributes, .gitignore, .git/, .vs/, .idea/, bin/, obj/, Thumbs.db` <br> *`.csproj, .cs, .sln`                                                                                                                                                                 |
| includePDB      | If true, line numbers in exceptions and stack traces will appear if the mod experiences problems. Also, Edit and Continue using Visual Studio is possible.            | false                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

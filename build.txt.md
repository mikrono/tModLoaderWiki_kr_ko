## About
You can create a build.txt file in the top level of your mod's source
directory to give it build properties. These properties are used during the building process of your mod and include information about the mod. Properties in this file may remind you of .ini files, where every key has a _name_ and _value_, delimited by an equals (`=`) sign.

```.ini
property = value
otherProperty = value1, value2, value3
```
**Note: Capitalization matters in this file! Bad capitalization will lead to errors during the build process.**

White spaces do not matter. However, each property must be
on its own line, list items must be separated by commas, and property
names must be on the left side of the equals sign.

## Available properties

| Property        | Description       | Default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

See [Expert Cross Mod Content](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Expert-Cross-Mod-Content) to learn how to properly use this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| weakReferences  | A list of mods that the mod will build against and can natively interact with, but don't necessarily have to be enabled. Basically optional modReferences, but require the modder to be a little more careful in programming to avoid binding errors. See [Expert Cross Mod Content](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Expert-Cross-Mod-Content) to learn how to properly use this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| noCompile       | Whether the mod should compile source code when being built or use a .dll file pre-compiled by the mod maker. By default this will be false if you do not include this property. The precompiled dll file must be named "ModName.dll", where `ModName` is your mod's name. | false
| homepage        | A link to the home website of the mod. This will be listed alongside the steam workshop page in the More Info menu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| hideCode        | If true, the unpacked mod that results from using the extract mod option will not include .dll files (compiled code), .pdb files (help with error messages) or .xml files (documentation). These files are essential to allowing cross-mod functionality so this option shouldn't be true if you intend to allow mods to properly interop with your mod.   | false                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| hideResources   | If true, the unpacked mod that results from using the extract mod option will not include resource files, such as .png files and .wav files. Use this if you would like to have your sounds and images freely available to other modders to view. If you use `includeSource`, this will also include those .cs files. | false                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| includeSource   | If true, the unpacked mod that results from using the extract mod option will include .cs files, provided `hideResources` is still false. Use this if you would like to share your code freely. If you are truly interested in community support for your mod, consider using [GitHub](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Intermediate-Git-&-mod-management) to allow others to contribute code to your mod.  | false                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| buildIgnore     | A list of file patterns to ignore during the build and packaging processes. To exclude a single file, simply write the filename: `Template.psd`, `Items/TestItem.cs`. To exclude a folder, write `FolderName/*`. | `build.txt`, files and folders beginning with `.`, `bin/*`, `obj/*`, and `Thumbs.db` are excluded by default. If `includeSource` is `false`, `.csproj`, `.cs`, and `.sln` files will also be excluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| sortAfter       | A list of other mods that this mod will be forced to load after. The last mod in the list alphabetically is the one this mod will be loaded after. <br> Only affects loading if this mod would normally be loaded before those other mods. <br> Automatically happens with mods listed in the `modReferences` list. <br> Name mods by their file name without the extension.
| sortBefore      | A list of other mods that this mod will be forced to load before.  This property can be considered the oppposite of the `sortAfter` property. <br> Name mods by their file name without the extension.
| playableOnPreview     | If false, the mod will refuse to load on a preview version of tModLoader.

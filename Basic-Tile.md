# Basic Tile
This guide serves to explain the basics of Tiles.

# What is a Tile?
It is important to clearly understand tiles in your mind. Starting out, you might confuse or conflate tiles and items. Items are things in your inventory. Tiles are blocks in the world. Many items in the game place tiles, but aside from the item placing the tile and the tile returning the tile, there is no enforced connection between an item and the tile it places. That said, most tiles modders will add will have 1 or many corresponding items. 

# Making an Tile
To add an tile to Terraria, we must first create a "class" that "inherits" from ModTile. To do so, make a .cs file in your mod's source directory (My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mod Sources\MyModName) and then open that file in your text editor. Paste the following into that file, replacing `NameHere` with the internal name of your tile and `ModNamespaceHere` with your mod's foldername/namespace. (A common mistake is to use apostrophes or spaces in internal names, don't do this, the computer won't understand.)

```cs
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using Terraria;
using Terraria.ModLoader;

namespace ModNamespaceHere
{
	public class NameHere : ModTile
	{
		public override void SetDefaults()
		{
			Main.tileSolid[Type] = true;
			Main.tileMergeDirt[Type] = true;
			Main.tileBlockLight[Type] = true;
			Main.tileLighted[Type] = true;
			dustType = mod.DustType("Sparkle");
			drop = mod.ItemType("ExampleBlock");
			AddMapEntry(new Color(200, 200, 200));
			// Set other values here
		}
	}
}
```

Now that you have a .cs file, bring in your texture file (a .png image file that you have made) and put it in the folder with this .cs file. Make sure read [Autoload](https://github.com/blushiemagic/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-Autoload) so you know how to satisfy what the computer expects for its filename and folder structure.

# Framed vs FrameImportant Tiles
There are 2 different types of Tiles. One type is the regular tiles that are 1x1 (width of 1, height of 1) and adjust themselves as you place similar tiles next to them. These will be referred to as "Framed" tiles in this guide. The other type are the tiles that do not change automatically. These tiles are usually larger than 1x1 so another name for them could be MultiTiles.   

Here is an example of the sprite of a Framed tile:

Here is an example the sprite of of a FrameImportant tile:    
![](https://i.imgur.com/s9ZtC9n.png)

As you might have noticed, FrameImportant tiles can have multiple unique tile "styles". You might have also noticed some empty space in the spritesheets, this is padding. These concepts will be explored later.

# Coordinates
Tile coordinates are 1/16th the size of World coordinates. Remember this if you ever need to do anything involving Tiles and anything else such as NPC, Player, or Projectile.

# Padding
When making a sprite, it is important to know proper dimensions. For the most part, every individual tile will be 16x16 pixels with 2 pixels of padding to the right and below each, for a total of 18x18.

# SetDefaults
Now that we've gone through some preliminary info, lets focus on SetDefaults and what to put in it. This section will explain most of the common items in SetDefaults. The point of SetDefaults is to define how the tile acts, such as is it solid, can things stand on it, and does lava kill it. Consulting similar tiles that you wish to emulate in ExampleMod is probably better than trying to do this from scratch. Many of the lines below set something to true, this means the default value is false. Don't bother including lines setting the value to the default, it just clutters your code.

For this guide, many gifs will refer to this tile sprite:

## Main.tileSolid[Type] = true;
Setting this to true means the tile will be solid. Projectiles will collide with it and NPC and Players can stand on it.    
True:    
![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/VelvetyComposedBellfrog-size_restricted.gif)    
False (default):    
![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/LinedWatchfulElectriceel-size_restricted.gif)    

## Main.tileSolidTop[Type] = true;
Many tiles, such as placed bars, tables, anvils, etc can be stood on but aren't solid. These tiles all set this value.    
True:    
![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PartialMedicalCaterpillar-size_restricted.gif)       

## Main.tileTable[Type] = true;
Some tiles, such as bottles, can only be placed on "tables". Be sure to set this for flat topped furniture tiles.    
True:    
![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CostlyFluffyArabianwildcat-size_restricted.gif)    
False (default):    
![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HighlevelMagnificentBlacklab-size_restricted.gif)   

## Main.tileMergeDirt[Type] = true;
This tile will merge with dirt using the extra sprites provided in the spritesheet.    
true:    
![](https://i.imgur.com/4RvCh3p.png)    
false (default):    
![](https://i.imgur.com/6UjS77f.png)    

## Main.tileBlockLight[Type] = true;	
TODO

## Main.tileLighted[Type] = true;
TODO

## Main.tileLavaDeath[Type] = true;
Set to True if you'd like your tile to die if hit by lava.

## Main.tileNoAttach[Type] = true;
Prevents tiles from attaching to this tile.    
True:    
![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AcidicSparseBumblebee-size_restricted.gif)    
False (default):    
![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AshamedHoarseAnt-size_restricted.gif)    

## Main.tileFrameImportant[Type] = true;
This changes a Framed tile to a FrameImportant tile. The frame important part of the name suggest that the frame is important, but what is frame? Frame is the coordinates within the spritesheet that the current tile should draw. For Framed tiles, the frame is never saved since the coordinate frame of a Framed tile is calculated when the world is loaded. For FrameImportant tiles, the world needs to save those coordinates, hence, "important". For modders, just remember to set this to true when you make a tile that uses a TileObjectData, or basically all tiles that aren't like dirt, ores, or other basic building tiles.
	
## ModTile fields: dustType, drop, adjTiles, etc
These are explained in the [documentation](http://blushiemagic.github.io/tModLoader/html/class_terraria_1_1_mod_loader_1_1_mod_tile.html#pub-attribs). 

## AddToArray(ref TileID.Sets.RoomNeeds.????);
Used to make a ModTile act as a lightsource, chair or table for the purposes of housing. Some examples:    
```cs
AddToArray(ref TileID.Sets.RoomNeeds.CountsAsTable);
AddToArray(ref TileID.Sets.RoomNeeds.CountsAsDoor);
AddToArray(ref TileID.Sets.RoomNeeds.CountsAsTorch);
AddToArray(ref TileID.Sets.RoomNeeds.CountsAsChair);
```    

## AddMapEntry			
AddMapEntry is for setting the color and optional text associated with the Tile when viewed on the map. Explore ExampleMod and the documentation for more info.

## Not covered in Basic level
There are other aspects of ModTiles that will be covered in more advanced guides:
* SubTile -- Advanced -- Allows a single tile to have different properties for different styles of the same tile. For example, the Obsidian Lantern is lava proof even though all the other Lanterns aren't.
* Alternate -- Advanced -- Allows a single tile style to have different placement and anchoring options.  For example, Torches have a left and right alternative in addition to the normal.

The following guide aims to teach some of the common ways of creating AI for npcs.  Most things can be used interchangeably between projectiles and npcs, just replace npc with projectile and vice versa. Some things cannot, and if there is a projectile alternative, it will be mentioned.   

To start, let's make a basic npc. This guide won't cover the things in set defaults, you can look at example mod and the [vanilla field values](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Vanilla-NPC-Field-Values) to get an idea of what to put.  Most of the AI we make will go into the AI hook, so override that.  
```cs
//other stuff
public override void AI(){
     //AI is called every frame.  Anything you put here will happen 60 times a second.
}
```

We now have a place to put our ai, but it doesn't do anything yet - let's start by changing the npcs velocity. 
 The velocity is a vector2(which is composed of 2 floats, x and y) corresponding to the x and y change of the npc every frame(60 times a second) in pixels after your ai happens.

A velocity of -5,5 means left 5 and down 5 pixels a frame(Keep in mind in Terraria, adding to y goes down). Changing velocity is the most common way to make your npc move, and it's kept in between frames - if I set it to 5,5 it will stay that way till something else changes it. 

Let's make the npc float upwards by changing the velocity. 
```cs
public override void AI(){
      npc.velocity = new Vector2(0, -5);//subtract from Y to go up
      //AI is called every frame.  Anything you put here will happen 60 times a second
}
```
If you test this code you should see your npc fly upwards.  You probably want your npc to do something more complex though, and to do that we need to start adding more things to our ai. 

//TODO gif of it in action

Timers are covered in this [guide](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Time-and-Timers), which you should read if you haven't already. Lets add a timer like this guide shows 
```cs
int Time = 0;
public override void AI(){
    Time++;
    //npc.velocity is the change in pixels of the npc each frame(60 times a second)
    npc.velocity = new Vector2(0, -5);//subtract from Y to go up
    //AI is called every frame.  Anything you put here will happen 60 times a second
}
```
Every tick our npc is alive, our npc happens, increasing the timer. This allows us to make things happen based on how long our npc has been alive instead of just doing things every tick.

Now that we have a variable to keep track of time we can make things happen on a timer with %. % computes the remainder after dividing its left operand by its right operand, and is useful for making things happen every x ticks like this
```cs
int Time;
public override void AI(){
     Time++;
     npc.velocity = new Vector2(0, -5);//subtract from Y to go up
     if(Time % 120 == 0){
           //things here happen once every 120 ticks, or 2 seconds
     }
     //AI is called every frame.  Anything you put here will happen 60 times a second
}
```
This first tick our npc is alive, our ai method happens. First time increments, making it 1. Next velocity is changed, then the if statement is checked. The Time % 120 takes the remainder of the 2. in this case its the remainder of 1/120, which is 1. Finally we check if its equal to 0 with ==0. 1 isnt, so the code in the brackets runs. Finally, after our ai runs the npc moves based on its velocity. Since our velocity is 0,-5, it moves that many pixels, ending up 5 pixels upwards from where its started.

1/60 of a second later, our ai runs again during the next tick. This time, Time becomes 2(if your wondering why Time kept its value in between ticks, its because its a field - its declared outside the method). Again, Time(2) % 120 is not 0, so our if statement doesn't activate. Finally our velocity is update again.

Our ai continues to run every tick, and our npc will float upward due to its velocity. After 60 ticks its been a second. After 120 ticks, its been 2 seconds, and the code in our if statement will activate, since 120 goes into 120 one time with a remainder of 0. After 240 ticks or 4 seconds, the if statment will activate again, as 240/120 is 2 with a remainder of 0. This pattern of it happening every 2 seconds or 120 ticks will continue until the npcs dies.

//TODO maybe gif with Time drawn above the npc
 
Now we can make something happen periodically, but what good is that if we cant actually do something?

 One of the most common things people want bosses to do is shoot a projectile, which is simple - call the NewProjectile method. But to spawn a projectile, you need to provide some information about the projectile to be spawned. Where should it start? should it do 15 damage or 500? Is it a wooden arrow or a projectile from another mod? 

The order for what information is filled out where is this:
```cs
Projectile.NewProjectile(float X, float Y, float SpeedX, float SpeedY, int Type, int Damage, float KnockBack, int Owner = 255, float ai0 = 0f, float ai1 = 0f);
```
Note that there is a different overload with Vector2s instead of floats for x/y and Speedx/SpeedY.  For consistency I will not be using it, but it is effectively the same.  

Float X is a float of the X coordinate to spawn at, Y is a float of the Y coordinate to spawn at(Where is our projectile?). SpeedX and SpeedY are both floats of the x and y velocity respectively to spawn with(What direction should our projectile go?).  

Type is the type of projectile(What projectile should be spawned?) This will either be a vanilla projectile ID, like 
`ProjectileID.WoodenArrowHostile` or a modded one, like `ModContent.ProjectileType<MyClass>()`  Make sure to be using either `Terraria.ID`or your projectiles class' namespace respectively. 

Damage is self explanatory, remember that setting projectile.Damage in the projectile doesn't do anything, it has to be set here.

//TODO iirc this is doubled and quadrupled in expert, check that

Knockback is also self explanatory, but notice it's a float, so it can take decimals.  

//TODO explain what amount of knockback goes what distances.

Owner, ai0, and ai1 are all optional parameters(see how they have = something after, which shows their default value) and can be safety ommited if you don't know to put.  Owner is the whoami of the player that "owns" the projectile, or 255 for none. ai0 and ai1 are used to pass information to the spawned projectile, and have their own section later in this guide

Seems like a lot, but thankfully it's much simpler to write
This code fires a wooden arrow projectile straight up from the npcs center, with 50 damage and no knockback 
```cs
Projectile.NewProjectile(npc.Center.X, npc.Center.Y, 0, -50, ProjectileID.WoodenArrowHostile, 50, 0f);
```  

As you can see each parameter is filled out with the information about how to create the projectile. We want it to spawn at the npc's center's x and y coordinate, with the a velocity of 0,-50 or up 50 pixels a tick. It should be a Wooden arrow that doest 50 damage and 0 knockback. 

 However, there, if you add this code into an ai, you may run into strange amounts of projectiles in multiplayer. The reason for this is due to how Terraria handles npcs in multiplayer. Imagine 2 people connected to a mutiplayer game, when your npc spawns.

 In this hypothetical game, your npc will created at 3 locations. On each client, and on the server. Each of these 3 locations will now run your ai code, just like it would be run in single player. On each client and the server, it moves exactly the same since the same ai is ran on each(unless something random is in . Then, the npc calls NewProjectile. On all 3 games the projectile is spawned, but then, all 3 sync their spawned projectiles to the other 2, and we end up with 3 on each - each connected client and the server spawning the projectile.

The solution? Dont shoot the projectile on the connected clients, then let NewProjectile sync them. We do this by checking `Main.netMode` which tells if we are in single player(equal to NetmodeID.SinglePlayer), a client(NetmodeID.MultiplayerClient), or a server(NetmodeID.Server).
```cs     
int Time;
public override void AI(){
     Time++;
     if(Time % 120 == 0 && Main.netMode != NetmodeID.MultiplayerClient){
          //if we arent a multiplayer client and it's been 120 ticks
          //things here happen once every 120 ticks, or 2 seconds
          Projectile.NewProjectile(npc.Center.X, npc.Center.Y, 0, -5, ProjectileID.WoodenArrowHostile, 50, 0f);
     }
     //AI is called every frame.  Anything you put here will happen 60 times a second
}
```
### Finding a Target
Now that we know how to shoot projectiles, let's make this attack harder to dodge by firing it at the player.  

To do that we need to find the players we want to target.  For finding the closest near a npc, this is very easy. 
First call `npc.TargetClosest(true/false)`,with true/false being if you want it the npc to change the sprite direction to face the target(it can also be left empty. This searches for a nearby play that can be target by the npc, then sets the player's whoami(whoamis will be covered in dpeth later, simply they are somethings place in their respective Main array)  to npc.Target.

We can then get the player with Main.Player[npc.Target] and store it in a player variable for use later. 
```cs
npc.TargetClosest(false);
Player target = Main.player[npc.target];
//we can now do things with target
```
 If we didn't want the closest but instead wanted some other condition checked, we could loop the Main.Player array to find a valid target.  

Additionally, if you are in a projectile and want to home in on a player target, this is one way to do it(keep in mind that TargetClosest isn't a thing for projectiles, that part at the start can be omitted).  

A better alternative to the above if you are shooting projectiles from a npc would be to pass the npcs target as an ai parameter(see the below section for how to pass information with ai parameters).
```cs
npc.TargetClosest(false);
Player p = Main.player[npc.target];//first get the closest just in case all of our checks fail
for(int i = 0; i < Main.maxPlayers; i++)
{
      if(Main.player[i].active){
           //add in other checks with &
           p = Main.player[i];
      }
}
//use p
```
With our player variable we can do tons of new things.  One common thing people do is to fire a projectile or make the boss move towards the player.  To do this first we get the direction to the player, and hold it in a Vector2 
```cs
public override void AI(){
     npc.TargetClosest(false);//first we setnpc.target to the closest person
     Player target = Main.player[npc.target]; //then we get the player from the array and store it in a variable.
     Vector2 ToPlayer = npc.DirectionTo(target.Center);//then we make a vector2 of the direction to the player's center.  
     //we can now use ToPlayer, as it contains which way the player is to us
     //If you want whatever you use ToPlayer for to go faster, multiply it by something like npc.Velocity = ToPlayer * 5f
}
```
Shooting a projectile would look like this  
```cs
int Time;
public override void AI(){
     Time++;//increase our timer so we can use it to track how many ticks we have been alive
     if(Time % 120 == 0 && Main.netMode != NetmodeID.MultiplayerClient)//if its been 120 ticks and we arent a client
     {
          npc.TargetClosest(false);//set npc.traget to the nearest player
          Player target = Main.player[npc.target];//get the player we just targeted 
          Vector2 ToPlayer = npc.DirectionTo(target.Center) * 5;//get the direction to the player. 5 is the speed 
          Projectile.NewProjectile(npc.Center.X, npc.Center.Y, ToPlayer.X, ToPlayer.Y, ProjectileID.WoodenArrowHostile, 50, 0f);//launch a projectile using the direction to the player we just got
     }
     //AI is called every frame.  Anything you put here will happen 60 times a second
}
```
Hopefully you understand what everything there does.  
the Time variable keeps track of the number of ticks the boss has been alive.  `if(Time %120 ==0)` checks if that variable is a multiple of 120, which will be every 120 ticks or 2 seconds.  

`npc.TargetClosest(false)` and `Player target = Main.Player[npc.target];` get the closest players and store it in a Player variable called target.  
`Vector2 ToPlayer = npc.DirectionTo(target.Center);` then stores the velocity we want to fire our projectile with in a Vector2(In this case the direction to the player from our npc).  Finally we spawn a projectile at the npcs center with the direction towards the player as velocity.
 
If we wanted to instead fly to a location we would just set npc.velocity to a direction Vector2 like so:
```cs
npc.TargetClosest(false);
Player target = Main.player[npc.target];
Vector2 ToPlayer = npc.DirectionTo(target.Center) * 3;
npc.velocity = ToPlayer; 
```

If we wanted a dash, we can just move the above code into a if statement like the projectile code. 
//TODO example + explain why
### Making Patterns
Most of the time we don't want our npc to do just one thing, instead we want to have more then "attack" it can be doing.  To do this you need to have a variable holding what attack is happening, so our npc can remember in between frames what it was doing.  

In this case we are using an `int` to hold the current stage. Our first attack will correspond to 0, second to 1, etc. Then, at the start of each ai tick, we can use this to continue doing the attack we did last frame.  

In order to make this code cleaner, I separated each attack into its own method and used constants to represent the "ID" of each phase. These constants mean the same thing as the number they represent, except being easier to read. Its means a lot more when you see `if(stage == ChaseState)` instead of `if(stage == 1)`.  

One other concern with having states is desync. When an npc has different things it could be doing at once, it is necessary that it is doing the same thing across all clients in multiplayer. 

The solution is to hold variables like our state in the npc.ai array. This array(of floats) is automatically synced in between clients, so our npc's state will always be the same across clients.  

The final change is to keep the code for each attack in its own method, then call them in ai. This is purely for organization, making it easier to read the code in the ai.  
  
```cs
//Constant variables used to make code readable
const int ProjectileState = 0;//Instead of checking if state is 0, we can check it is ProjectileSate.  In application they mean the same thing, but the former is much nicer to look at.
const int ChaseState = 1;
const int CircleProjectileState = 2;
//here I create the variable used to hold which state we are in. 
//Using properties, this variable is effectively the same as npc.ai[0]. setting its value sets ai[0], and getting its value returns ai[0].
//This is done because if we are in multiplayer, our state might not be the same on different clients/the server, leading to npc desync. To avoid this, we use one of the ai array elements as our state. This array is synced between clients and the server, so our npc won't desync.
float State
{
    get => npc.ai[0]; //When getting this variable's value, instead return the vaule of npc.ai[0] 
    set => npc.ai[0] = value; //when setting this variable to something, instead set the value of npc.ai[0]
}
//You could write npc.ai[0] instead of state, and it would work the same, but this makes code more readable. Alternatively, if you are out of npc.ai slots to use or dont want to use it, you could use the receive and send extra ai hooks to sync your vaules. 

//here I do the same thing, just with our timer and a different ai slot.
float Timer
{
    get => npc.ai[1];
    set => npc.ai[1] = value;
}
public override void AI()
{
    //since all states Increase Timer and use npc.Target, we can put the code all of them would have the same here
    Timer++;//Increase our timer by one
    npc.TargetClosest(false);//set npc.Target to the closests player.
    if (State == ProjectileState)
    {
        ProjectileAttack();//run the attack method
        if (Timer == 180)
        {
            //if it has been 3 seconds,
            Timer = 0;//reset timer
            State = ChaseState;//go to a another state
            /*What if I want random attacks, not a set order? 
            use Main.rand.Next(bottom, top +1) to get a random number, so we would use it like this
            state = Main.rand.Next(0,3);//get a random number 0-2
            npc.netUpdate = true;//update our npc this tick
            */
        }
    }
    else if (State == ChaseState)
    {
        Chase(); //call the chase method defined below 
        if (Timer == 240)
        {
            //if it has been 4 seconds
            Timer = 0;//reset timer
            npc.velocity = Vector2.Zero;//since we change the velocity in this state, we need to reset it before moving to a new stage.
            State = CircleProjectileState; //set our state to another one
                                           //state = Main.rand.Next(0,3); - random state
                                           //npc.netUpdate = true;
        }
    }
    else if (State == CircleProjectileState)
    {

        }
    }
}

    {
        //if it has been 60 ticks and we aren't a Mutliplayer client
        for (int i = 0; i < 360; i += 12)
        {
            //loop till i = 360, for one full rotation. You can change the interval of rotation by changing the 12 
            Player target = Main.player[npc.target];//get the closest player
            Vector2 ToPlayer = npc.DirectionTo(target.Center).RotatedBy(MathHelper.ToRadians(i));//By default, rotation uses radians.  I prefer to use degrees, and therefore I convert the radians. 
            if (Main.netMode != NetmodeID.MultiplayerClient)
                Projectile.NewProjectile(npc.Center.X, npc.Center.Y, ToPlayer.X * 5, ToPlayer.Y * 5, ProjectileID.WoodenArrowHostile, 50, 0f);//fire the projectile
        }
    }
}
```

### Using WhoAmI and the Main.  Arrays
Sometimes we want to spawn a npc( it could also be a projectile or even a dust) and have it do something that requires finding the target, position or some other value from the npc that spawned it, or requires finding out if the spawned npc is alive/what it's hp is or some other property of a npc that isnt us.

Every npc, projectile, dust and player active in the world(and some that aren't active) are all part of their arrays(arrays are like groups of one data type instead of just one. for example, Main.npc is 500 npcs all in one spot. To access one item in the array, you use array[x], where x is the Xth thing in the array). These are how the game keeps track of what things to update, draw sync, etc. They also serve another important function, allowing one thing to effect another thing through these arrays. 

These arrays are:
//TODO get the rest of the lengths

* Main.projectile, which holds up to 499 projectiles + one dummy projectile(more on these later)  
* Main.dust  
* Main.npc  
* Main.player, Holding 254 players + one dummy player

When something is created, say a projectile via NewProjectile, a spot in its array(in this case Main.projectile) is given to it, and a new projectile object created for it there. 

When this projectile is created, its whoami is set to its place in the array. Additionally, the method to spawn it(NewProjectile) will return that place in the array. This happens for dust and npcs to. You can use this to modify the projectile after its fired like this:

```cs
int Index = Projectile.NewProjectile(parameters);//you will obviously need to fill in the parameters
Projectile p = Main.projectile[Index];//this can be applied to npcs too - use NPC n = Main.npc[Index]; after calling NewNPC
// you can now use it's fields/methods
//for example p.Center , p.active , or p.Kill()
NetMessage.SendData(MessageID.SyncProjectile, -1, -1, null, Index);//after make sure to call this to ensure the projectile gets synced to multiplayer clients
//if its a npc, replace the first parameter with MessageID.SyncNPC
//Like: NetMessage.SendData(MessageID.SyncNPC, -1, -1, null, Index); 
```

if `Main.projectile[Index];` looks a familiar to you before, its because you have already used something similar to get a player to target. 

But what if I want my spawned projectile(or npc) to have the WhoAmI of the "parent" that spawned it? This is one of the times we use those optional parameters of the spawning methods.   

If you look at either NewNPC/Projectiles parameters, you should see floats like ai0, ai1 etc.  These are used to pass info to the spawned thing.
 Let's say I set ai0 to 15 in NewProjectile/NewNPC -  then in the projectile or npc, npc/projectile.ai[0] will be 15.  And, more importantly if I set it to the WhoAmI of the parent, I can then get the parent with npc/projectile.ai[0].
```cs
//In the Parent
Projectile.NewProjectile(npc.Center.X, npc.Center.Y, ToPlayer.X * 5, ToPlayer.Y * 5, ProjectileID.WoodenArrow, 50,0f,255, npc.WhoAmI);

// In the spawned Projectile
NPC owner = Main.NPC([(int)projectile.ai[0]];//not how I put (int) here - since the ai parameters are floats and can be decimals, I have to cast them to a whole number to access the array(Note this does not round, it just removes everything past the decimal point.)
```

You can also use the ai parameters to pass other info, such as the whoami of a target player, the amount of time left in an attack, etc.

A common mistake modders make is to assume if something is in its array, and not null, its active in the world. This is not the case. If a npc(or projectile/dust/etc) dies, it remains in the array until its replaced by a new thing spawning.  However, it will have npc/projectile/dust.Active set to false, stopping it from updating. If your loop these arrays yourself, look out for these inactive objects.

Another thing to keep in mind is the "dummy" slots I mentioned earlier. These arrays have one extra slot at the end that is not updated, instead it hold a dummy object that doesn't do anything and should be ignored when looking through the arrays.  When looping them, use Main.maxProjectiles and the other array counterparts to avoid the dummy slot.

### Making Phases
You can make your NPC choose different attacks based on certain factors, and make your code overall more organized by making your phase choosing code in it's own method, then call instead of setting state in the attack.
Let's look one phase from before, but this time make the state be set to a new phase we added if hp is below 50 by checking `npc.life` and `lifeMax` before setting it
```cs

if(npc.life < (npc.lifeMax / 2){
     //if below 50, set it to something else, like an stage 2 attack
     State = Below50Attack;//Random? Main.rand.Next(LowestStageAttack , HighestStageAttack + 1); 
}
else
{
     state = Main.rand.Next(0,3);//go to a another state
}
```
Thing is, if we want it to transition after every attack, we would have to put this code in every single state in the first phase, which is a lot of unnecessary code and causes other issues.
Instead we can make a method to change the phase, then call it in our phases.
```cs
private int ChoosePhase(){
     //notices this is an int, not void. This means it has to return a value(in this case of the type int)  
     npc.netUpdate = true;//update this npc this tick, to sync our state.
     if(npc.life < (npc.lifeMax / 2)){
          return Main.rand.Next(4, 7);//if we are below half our hp, return 4-6.  Then in ai we will check what state is set to 
     }
     /* else if(somecondtion){
          //add more like this
          return somethingelse;
     }*/
     return Main.rand.Next(0, 3);//since we will have already returned if below 50, we don't need to do this in an else.  
}

//then in our each of our states, we call it to run the code above.
if(timer == phaselength){
     //replace phaselength with the amount of ticks to attack for before swapping
     State = ChoosePhase();//call the method to get a new state. This makes the code above happen and sets State to whatever was returned 
}
```
This way, we avoid having to put the same code over and over, and if we want to edit this code later(like adding another state or removing one) we only need to change it in one spot. 
### Making a NPC Despawn
To despawn a npc, you just need to set npc.active to false.  Of course, you only want your npc to despawn under some conditions. The most common is to make a npc to despawn if there's nobody around to fight.  To do this we need to check if a valid target exist, and if there isnt, we despawn.

First we check if the current target is dead or if something else would cause us to want to despawn
```cs
if(!player.active || player.dead){
     //if the player we are currently targeting is dead or not "active"(meaning the player is no longer playing)
     npc.TargetClosest(false);//try to find a new target
     player = Main.player[npc.target];//get the new target we just got
          if(!player.active || player.dead) {
                // if the new one is also dead, then we know there is no active player, and can despawn 
                npc.active = false;//set ourselves to inactive, this makes it so we don't drop loot and instead disappear
          }
}
```
//TODO: despawning based on other conditions such as biome(if your reading this, you probably will just need to loop the player array then check if they are not in the biome with !player.desiredzone    
Projectile despawning happens automatically after TimeLeft runs out(which you should set in setdefaults).  If you want to manually get rid of it call `projectile.Kill();`
If you don't want the projectile to despawn after a certain amount of time, set projectile.TimeLeft to be greater then 1 in ai.   Since ai is called every tick, it will always never drop to 0 and the projectile will never despawn(however this combined with no tile collide causes some strange side effects, like breaking queen be larva across the map, so use it sparingly).
### Animation

NPC's and projectiles have different ways of animating, this part shows a npc. For a projectile change projectile.Frame instead of using the find frame hook.

Both of these require a sprite sheet, split into each frame(way the npc/projectile can look) stacked on top of each other evenly.  

For example look at flutter slime from example mods sprite sheet:  

<img src="https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/blob/1.3/ExampleMod/NPCs/FlutterSlime.png?raw=true" alt="FlutterSlime.png"/>  

Each frame represents a way the npc can look, and your sprite sheets should also look like this.  

The sprite sheet I will be using looks like this:  

//TODO redo this to make it clear what frame number each one is  + Gifs

![New Piskel (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88946983/153733783-68d06f09-d436-428a-b0e6-ccee462e610b.png)


After making our sprite sheet like the one above, we need to register the amount of frames in it in the SetStaticDefaults hook
```cs
public override void SetStaticDefaults() {
     // Other things
     Main.npcFrameCount[npc.type] = 4; // We want 4 frames in our npc. 
}
```

When this happens, the game takes our sprite sheet and evenly cuts it up into however many frames we specified(in this case 4). 

//TODO Add a picture of sprite sheet as the game would separate it.

Now, we need to change the frame in order to animate our npc. To do this, we need to override the `FindFrame(int frameHeight)` hook, and change which frame of our sheet to draw.  

In the FindFrame hook, you may have noticed the one integer parameter, frameHeight. This is the height of one of our frames(if you have a 5 framed sheet thats 50 pixels tall, it will be 10) and should be mutplied by the frame you want to get what to set npc.frame.Y to.
  

Setting npc.frame.Y to `frameHeight * 3` will be the 4th frame, setting it to `0 * frameHeight`(or just 0) will be the first frame, as thats the bottom of the frame we want to draw.  

In order to make code easier to read, instead of putting the frame number, like 5, you can assign constants that describe what each frame does.  
`npc.FrameY = frameHeight * FlyingFrame` means a lot more to anyone reading then `npc.FrameY = frameHeight * 3`.  

If your code looks like the example above in the making patterns section, you can check you state variable just like you do in ai.  In fact, we can use some logic very similar to ai to determine which frame we should be. This code shows making a different frame assuming your code looks like the example above.  
```cs
const int FrameLaunchingProjectiles = 0;//The first frame will be in the "launching projectiles" state
const int FrameChaseOne = 1;//the second and third frames will be in the Chase state, and we will loop through them
const int FrameChaseTwo= 2;
const int CircleAttackFrame = 3;//the fourth frame will be in the circle attack
public override void FindFrame(int frameHeight) {
     //here, we change npc.frame.Y to choose what frame
     if(state ==  ProjectileState){
          //if we are in the projectile launching state
          npc.frame.Y =  frameHeight * FrameLaunchingProjectiles;//set which frame to draw to be the first one. 
     }
     else if(state == ChaseState){
          //if we are in the chase state:
          //because we have 2 different frames we want to loop through, we must use a frame timer.
          npc.frameCounter++;//there is already one for npcs, so we use that one.
          if(npc.frameCounter < 30){
                //if it has been less then 30 ticks
                npc.frame.Y = frameHeight * FrameChaseOne;//go to the first frame in our animtation for this state
          }
          else if(npc.frameCounter <60){
               //if it has been more then 30 ticks and less then 60
               npc.frame.Y = frameHeight * FrameChaseTwo;//go to the second frame
          }
          else{
              npc.frameCounter = 0;//reset the timer, restarting the animation.
          }
     }
     else{
          npc.frame.Y = frameHeight * CircleAttackFrame;
    }
}
```

# Common behaviors
### Spawning A NPC
Spawning npc is a lot like a projectile but instead you use NPC.NewNPC

It's parameters are NewNPC(int X, int Y, int Type, int Start = 0, float ai0 = 0f, float ai1 = 0f, float ai2 = 0f, float ai3 = 0f, int Target = 255)
  
Remember all the ones with a = after are optional, and you only need to put a value for if you know what you're doing. X and Y are self explanatory, and Type is just like in NewProjectile - vanilla npcs would be NPCID.Name and modded is `Modcontent.NPCType<Class>().`  

Start is almost never used. Its the index to start looking for a place in the array for the npc to be placed. If its set to 100, then its WhoAmI will be 100 or above. This largely has no practical use, and can be safely left at 0. 

ai0-ai3 are the same as in projectile - their values are copied over to the ai array in npcs.  

Target is  what npc.Target is set to in the spawned npc.  
### Fire a burst of something
You can make code execute more then once in ai with a for loop. If you want to make your projectiles inaccurate or not all fired towards one spot read the "Changing Projectiles Direction" section below, making use of the loop variable. 
### Changing Projectiles Direction When Fired
To change where the projectile is fired you need to affect the `float SpeedX` and `float SpeedY`(assuming you're still using the code from above, this is ToPlayer X/Y). There's a number of handy methods that you can use on a Vector2 to change it's contents.  

One of the most useful is `RotatedBy(double Radians)` or `RoatatedByRandom`. This rotates the Vector2's contents, making it usefully for shooting ahead of a target or making a spread/shotgun pattern.  Keep in mind it takes Radians not degrees so make sure to use `MathHelper.ToRadians` if you have a degree measurement.

Example usage - shooting a circle of thing
 ```cs
for(int i = 0; i < 360; i += 12){
      //loop till i = 360, for one full rotation. You can change the interval of rotation by changing the 12 
      Player target = Main.player[npc.target];
      Vector2 ToPlayer = npc.DirectionTo(target.Center).RotatedBy(MathHelper.ToRadians(i));//By default, rotation uses radians.  I prefer to use degrees, and therefore I convert them to radians. 
      if (Main.netMode != NetmodeID.MultiplayerClient)
            Projectile.NewProjectile(npc.Center.X, npc.Center.Y, ToPlayer.X * 5, ToPlayer.Y * 5, ProjectileID.WoodenArrowHostile, 50, 0f);//fire the projectile
}
```
### How Do I Spawn My NPC Like Vanilla Bosses
Spawning your boss is simple, just call `NPC.SpawnOnPlayer(player.WhoAmI, ModContent.NPCType<Class>());`, with player being the person to spawn on.  This even handles the "boss has awoken" in chat.
### How Do I Make my NPC/Projectile Give a Debuff
To do this we need to override `OnHitPlayer(Player player, int damage, bool crit)` for npcs or `ModifyHitPlayer(Player target, ref int damage, ref bool crit)` for projectiles and call player(npcs) or target(projectiles).AddBuff(int type, int duration) 
Keep in mind that duration is in ticks. 60 = one second
```cs
public override void OnHitPlayer(Player player, int damage, bool crit){
      //note this is a differently named hook in projectiles
      player.AddBuff(BuffID.Cursed, 240);//240 = 4 seconds. 
      //you can change the buff by using a buff ID.  Modded buffs should use ModContent.BuffType<Class>()
}
```
### How do I Make Something Talk in Chat
To print a message in chat, put Main.NewText("Text", new Color(r,g,b)).  R, G, and B are  numbers 0-255 of the message's color. 

### How do I Give my npc Drops
Read [the drops guide](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-NPC-Drops-and-Loot  )
### How Do I Make a Worm Boss
Worm bosses take significantly more code then this guide covers.  Example mod shows an example of what worm code would look like here: 
[1.4](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/blob/dd44e70738e29e5ded0cb979355b671b41f56efe/ExampleMod/Content/NPCs/Worm.cs  )

# Common Errors
Remember google is your friend when trying to find how to fix an error. 
### The Type or Namespace something Cannot be Found
Keep in mind c# is case sensitive - Projectile is not the same as projectile. 
If "Something" is not from your mod
This probably means you forgot an using.  If you're on vs, it should automatically recommend them.  If you're not, try looking around if it's in example mod and adding the usings it has.  Adding
```cs
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;
using Terraria;
using Terraria.ID;
using Terraria.ModLoader;
using System;
```
Should cover most of them.  If it doesn't and you can't find it make sure you haven't misspelled anything. 
If "Something" is from your mod, make sure it's spelled correctly.  If it is, go to it's file and make sure you're using it's namespace. 

### Cannot implicitly convert type 'float' to 'int'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)
This means you tried to use a float(variable that can hold decimals) for something that uses an int(variable that only holds whole number).  You can solve this easily by "casting it" by adding (int) before, but keep in mind this will cause everything right of the decimal point to be removed.  You can get a rounded number with
`(int)Math.Round(MyFloat);`

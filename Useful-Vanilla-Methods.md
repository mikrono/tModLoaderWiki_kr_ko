This is a collection of vanilla methods that are useful when modding. This list is meant as a quick reference to the most commonly used methods, but with more advanced mods it is highly recommended to add Terraria as a reference to your IDE since this list isn't exhaustive.

##Item  
###public static int NewItem(int X, int Y, int Width, int Height, int Type, int Stack = 1, bool noBroadcast = false, int pfix = 0, bool noGrabDelay = false, bool reverseLookup = false)
Spawns an item in the world. Commonly seen used in ModNPC.NPCLoot. X, Y, Width, and Height are commonly derived from the npc. 
Example: `Item.NewItem((int)npc.position.X, (int)npc.position.Y, npc.width, npc.height, mod.ItemType("ExampleItem"));`

##Projectile  
###public static int NewProjectile(float X, float Y, float SpeedX, float SpeedY, int Type, int Damage, float KnockBack, int Owner = 255, float ai0 = 0f, float ai1 = 0f)
Spawns a projectile in the world. The owner variable should pretty much always be set to Main.myPlayer.

##Dust  
###public static int NewDust(Vector2 Position, int Width, int Height, int Type, float SpeedX = 0f, float SpeedY = 0f, int Alpha = 0, Color newColor = default(Color), float Scale = 1f)
Spawns a dust in the world. 

## Player  
### public void QuickSpawnItem(int item, int stack = 1)
Spawns an item right on a player, a simple alternative to Item.NewItem.
### public bool HasItem(int type)
Determines if the player has the specified item in their inventory. Example: `if(player.HasItem(mod.ItemType("SpectreGun"))){...}`
### public void AddBuff(int type, int time1, bool quiet = true)
Adds a buff to a player.
### public int HasBuff(int type)
Returns -1 if the player doesn't have the buff, and an index (0 to 21) if the player does.

##NPC
###public static int NewNPC(int X, int Y, int Type, int Start = 0, float ai0 = 0f, float ai1 = 0f, float ai2 = 0f, float ai3 = 0f, int Target = 255)
Spawns an NPC in the world. Example: `NPC.NewNPC(i, j, mod.NPCType("PuritySpirit"));`
###public void AddBuff(int type, int time, bool quiet = false)
Adds a buff to an NPC. Example: `Main.npc[i].AddBuff(BuffID.Ichor, 60);`
###public int HasBuff(int type)
Returns -1 if the NPC doesn't have the buff, and an index (0 to 4) if the NPC does. Example: `if (npc.HasBuff(BuffID.Cursed) >= 0){...}`

##Main  
###public static void PlaySound(int type, int x = -1, int y = -1, int Style = 1)
Plays a sound. Type is the category and style is the sound within that category. x and y give the sound a position, but can be left as -1 for center.
###public static void NewText(string newText, byte R = 255, byte G = 255, byte B = 255, bool force = false)
Prints text messages to the console.

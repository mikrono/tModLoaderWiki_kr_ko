## Installation
If you still need to install tModLoader refer to the [tModLoader guide for players](tModLoader-guide-for-players).

## Developing with tModLoader
Before you begin, you will two things, the ".NET 6 SDK" and a suitable IDE. Once you have these installed, you should start with the [Basic tModLoader Modding Guide](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Modding-Guide).

### IDE
Choose your favorite IDE to mod with tModLoader. Refer to the [development section](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki#development) on the homepage. For the best mod making experience, using Visual Studio is highly recommended.

### .NET 6 SDK
If you installed any IDE other than Visual Studio, you will have to manually install the [.NET 6 SDK](https://aka.ms/vscDocs/dotnet/download). If you installed Visual Studio and still don't have the .NET 6 SDK, you likely skipped the required workload, see [Developing with Visual Studio - Prerequisites](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Developing-with-Visual-Studio#prerequisites) to fix this.

To verify that you have the ".NET 6 SDK" properly installed, you can open a command prompt and type `dotnet --list-sdks` and press enter. If you see a result with a version starting with the number 6, it is installed.

## I am new to modding

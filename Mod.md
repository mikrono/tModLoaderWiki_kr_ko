# Mod

Mod is an abstract class that you will override. It serves as a central place from which the mod's contents are stored. It provides methods for you to use or override.

## Properties

### public string Name

Stores the name of the mod. This name serves as the mod's identification, and also helps with saving everything your mod adds.

### public ModProperties Properties

Stores the properties of the mod.

## Methods

### public abstract void SetModInfo(out string name, ref ModProperties properties)

Override this method in order to give your mod a name and set its properties.

### public virtual void Load()

Override this method to add most of your content to your mod. Here you will call other methods such as AddItem. This is guaranteed to be called after all content has been autoloaded.

### public virtual void PostSetupContent()

Allows you to load things in your mod after its content has been setup (arrays have been resized to fit the content, etc).

### public virtual void Unload()

This is called whenever this mod is unloaded from the game. Use it to undo changes that you've made in Load that aren't automatically handled (for example, modifying the texture of a vanilla item). Mods are guaranteed to be unloaded in the reverse order they were loaded in.

### public virtual void AddCraftGroups()

Override this method to add craft groups to this mod. You must add craft groups by calling the AddCraftGroup method here.

### public void AddCraftGroup(string name, string displayName, params int[] items)

Adds a craft group to this mod with the specified internal name, display name, and items.

### public CraftGroup GetCraftGroup(string name)

Gets the CraftGroup object of this mod with the corresponding internal name.

### public virtual void AddRecipes()

Override this method to add recipes to the game. It is recommended that you do so through instances of ModRecipe, since it provides methods that simplify recipe creation.

### public void AddItem(string name, ModItem item, string texture)

Adds a type of item to your mod with the specified internal name. This method should be called in Load. You can obtain an instance of ModItem by overriding it then creating an instance of the subclass. The texture parameter follows the same format for texture names of ModLoader.GetTexture.

### public ModItem GetItem(string name)

Gets the ModItem instance corresponding to the name. Because this method is in the Mod class, conflicts between mods are avoided. Returns null if no ModItem with the given name is found.

### public int ItemType(string name)

Gets the internal ID / type of the ModItem corresponding to the name. Returns 0 if no ModItem with the given name is found.

### public void AddGlobalItem(string name, GlobalItem globalItem)

Adds the given GlobalItem instance to this mod with the provided name.

### public GlobalItem GetGlobalItem(string name)

Gets the GlobalItem instance with the given name from this mod.

### public void AddItemInfo(string name, ItemInfo info)

Adds the given type of item information storage to the game, using the provided name.

### public int AddEquipTexture(ModItem item, EquipType type, string name, string texture, string armTexture = "", string femaleTexture = "")

Adds an equipment texture of the specified type, internal name, and associated item to your mod. (The item parameter may be null if you don't want to associate an item with the texture.) You can then get the ID for your texture by calling EquipLoader.GetEquipTexture, and using the EquipTexture's Slot property. If the EquipType is EquipType.Body, make sure that you also provide an armTexture and a femaleTexture. Returns the ID / slot that is assigned to the equipment texture.

### public int AddEquipTexture(EquipTexture equipTexture, ModItem item, EquipType type, string name, string texture, string armTexture = "", string femaleTexture = "")

Adds an equipment texture of the specified type, internal name, and associated item to your mod. This method is different from the other AddEquipTexture in that you can specify the class of the equipment texture, thus allowing you to override EquipmentTexture's hooks. All other parameters are the same as the other AddEquipTexture.

### public EquipTexture GetEquipTexture(string name)

Gets the EquipTexture instance corresponding to the name. Returns null if no EquipTexture with the given name is found.

### public int GetEquipSlot(string name)

Gets the slot/ID of the equipment texture corresponding to the given name. Returns -1 if no EquipTexture with the given name is found.

### public sbyte GetAccessorySlot(string name)

Same as GetEquipSlot, except returns the number as an sbyte (signed byte) for your convenience.

### public void AddFlameTexture(ModItem item, string texture)

Assigns a flame texture to the given item added by your mod. Flame textures are drawn when held by the player if the item's "flame" field is set to true. Flame textures are currently only used for torches.

### public void AddDust(string name, ModDust dust, string texture = "")

Adds a type of dust to your mod with the specified name. Create an instance of ModDust normally, preferably through the constructor of an overriding class. Leave the texture as an empty string to use the vanilla dust sprite sheet.

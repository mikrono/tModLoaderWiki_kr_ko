# Basic Prerequisites
Before consulting any of the Basic-level guides, please read below so you are prepared for Basic-level concepts. 

## Syntax
The Basic guides don't require too much programming knowledge, but they do require a basic understanding of c# syntax. Please read and internalize the following.
* [C# Syntax Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_basic_syntax.htm)

## Text Editor
Another thing you will need is a text editor. Your operating system comes with one, but there are better ones available. Below is a list of included text editors and suggested replacements. 
* Windows: Notepad -> [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* Linux: GEdit -> ??
* Mac: ??

Why do we need a good text editor? A good text editor can open multiple files in tabs, highlight syntax and keywords, and provide line numbers. All of these features will make modding much easier. See below to see how much more capable Notepad++ is compared to Notepad:

## What about Visual Studio or other IDEs?
You might have heard of Visual Studio. We will discuss IDEs later in Intermediate Prerequisites. If you feel confident, feel free to skip the Text Editor stage of skill to go straight to the IDE stage.

## Drawing Program
One last thing you will need is a picture editor. We will make all our sprites in this program. Paint will NOT work, as it can not save transparent pixels. See below for commonly used programs used by modders:
* Adobe Photoshop -- Expensive and capable but not intended for sprite work
* [Piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/) -- Free

# Introduction
## About
This guide explores IL editing. IL editing is an expert level technique that can be very powerful. With IL editing, mods can essentially edit code anywhere in the Terraria code base without relying on tModLoader hooks. IL editing stands for Intermediate Language editing, essentially we are editing compiled code on demand. This can be useful for very obscure methods that don't warrant a tModLoader method. With IL editing, it is crucial that your code employs defensive programming techniques to properly anticipate the potential of other mods attempting to modify the same area in the code. IL editing is powerful, but always try to utilize the tModLoader hooks if possible as they can facilitate multiple mods better than IL editing. If you aren't scared yet, read on. 

### Limitations
Be aware that the Common Language Runtime (CLR) will in-line short methods at runtime, these methods cannot be edited using these techniques. What counts as short isn't well defined, but things like Properties are likely candidates.

## Prerequisites
* [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy) - We will use the compile functionality to help design our patch.
* [Expert Prerequisites](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Expert-Prerequisites) - You will fail if you don't know how to debug.
* [Advanced Vanilla Code Adaption](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Advanced-Vanilla-Code-Adaption) - Familiarity with finding things in the Terraria source code is very helpful.
* Visual Studio or similar IDE is required.

## Code Layout
You can put patches anywhere you want, but `Mod.Load` or any of the `Autoload` methods are good candidates. 

# Example - Hive Pack Upgrade
## Goal
The goal that this guide will work toward is making the various bee related items stronger when wearing an upgrade to the [Hive Pack](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Hive_Pack). Various items will spawn bees as weapons. If the player is wearing the Hive Pack, `player.strongBees` will be true and spawned bees will have a random chance of spawning as GiantBee instead. To implement our Hive Pack upgrade, we need to modify the code referencing `player.strongBees` to give it a chance to spawn a Beenade as well.

Here is how Bee weapons currently work while the Hive Pack is equipped ([video](https://gfycat.com/MagnificentLividHuia)):

Notice how about half of the bees spawn as GiantBees.

## Original Method
Lets first look at the original method to see what changes we'll want to make to the IL code. Start up dnSpy and add the exe by going to File->Open and then browsing to Terraria.exe. Expand the tabs for Terraria, Terraria.exe, Terraria, and finally Player. Scroll down and click on the `beeType()` method. How did I know this was where I need to look? Experience. I followed the logic of the bee weapons in decompiled code and found that `Player.beeType` is the method that makes the decisions I want to modify. If you are reading this, you probably have already identified a method that you wish to change since you are resorting to IL editing. By now you should see this:      
![](https://i.imgur.com/9fOlM4n.png)    
```cs
public int beeType()
{
	if (this.strongBees && Main.rand.Next(2) == 0)
	{
		this.makeStrongBee = true;
		return 566;
	}
	this.makeStrongBee = false;
	return 181;
}
```
This is the C# code for this method. If you look in `Terraria.ID.ProjectileID`, you'll see that 566 is `GiantBee` and 181 is `Bee`. Our plan is to change the chosen projectile to `Beenade` (183) with random chance. This is how the code we want would look:    
```cs
public int beeType()
{
	if (this.strongBees && Main.rand.Next(2) == 0)
	{
		this.makeStrongBee = true;
		if(this.GetModPlayer<ExamplePlayer>().strongBeesUpgrade && Main.rand.NextBool(10))
			return ProjectileID.Beenade;
		return 566;
	}
	this.makeStrongBee = false;
	return 181;
}
```
This is great, but what now? First, lets use dnSpy to look at the IL Code for this method. In the Menu Bar, click the dropdown combo box and switch from C# to IL. This is what we see:    
```cs
// Token: 0x0600050A RID: 1290 RVA: 0x0023D2D0 File Offset: 0x0023B4D0

	/* 0x0023B4FF 2A           */ IL_002E: ret
} // end of method Player::beeType
```
Lets make sense of this now by following along. Be sure to hover or click on individual instructions to open the [OpCode documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes_fields(v=vs.110).aspx) directly from dnSpy:    
```cs
// ldarg.0 pushes (loads) the first argument (argument 0) onto the stack.
// This method has no arguments, what is going on?
// In truth, non-static methods have the current instance (this) as the first argument,
// it is there even though it isn't in the method parameters.
IL_0000: ldarg.0
// Next, the value of strongBees is pushed to the stack
IL_0001: ldfld     bool Terraria.Player::strongBees
// If that value is false, jump (branch) to IL_0022 (instruction at 0x0022 in method)
IL_0006: brfalse.s IL_0022

// Push the static field Main.rand onto the stack
IL_0008: ldsfld    class Terraria.Utilities.UnifiedRandom Terraria.Main::rand
// and then push 2 onto the stack
IL_000D: ldc.i4.2
// and then call Main.rand's "Next" method, pushing the result onto the stack.
IL_000E: callvirt  instance int32 Terraria.Utilities.UnifiedRandom::Next(int32)
// If the top of the stack (the result of "Next") is non-zero, jump to IL_0022.
IL_0013: brtrue.s  IL_0022

// Push the Player instance onto the stack
IL_0015: ldarg.0
// Push 1 into the stack (remember, 1 is true)
IL_0016: ldc.i4.1
// Set Player.makeStrongBee to true.
IL_0017: stfld     bool Terraria.Player::makeStrongBee
// Push 566 onto the stack.
IL_001C: ldc.i4    566
// Return the top of the stack, 566.
IL_0021: ret

// Push the Player instance onto the stack
IL_0022: ldarg.0
// Push 0 into the stack (remember, 0 is false)
IL_0023: ldc.i4.0
// Set Player.makeStrongBee to false
IL_0024: stfld     bool Terraria.Player::makeStrongBee
// Push 181 onto the stack
IL_0029: ldc.i4    181
// Return the top of the stack, 181.
IL_002E: ret
```
Hopefully this annotated IL Code can help you make sense of things. If you are confused, it might be worth your while learning about stacks and other things related to how computers run instructions.    
Now that we've gotten an idea about the original method, let's use dnSpy to see how our changes will look. In dnSpy, right click on the method and click `Edit Method (C#)...`.     
![](https://i.imgur.com/vKEjicD.png)    
In the window that pops up, make the changes we decided on earlier and then click Compile.    
![](https://i.imgur.com/ojUkfez.png)    
You'll see some errors if you are missing assembly references or bad code. First off, we need to add `using Terraria.ID;` and `using ExampleMod` to the code. Then, we need to add the missing references for Relogic and ExamplePlayer. You'll find ReLogic.dll in `\Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\references`. You'll find ExampleMod.dll in `\Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\references\mods\` if you used the Extract Mod tool in-game or `\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Modding\ModLoader\ExampleMod\bin\Debug\net45\` if you have built the mod in Visual Studio. Add both of these dlls to dnSpy via "Add Assembly Reference":    
![](https://i.imgur.com/U6f23SK.png)       
Now that we have fixed the errors, click "Compile" and the window will close and you'll be back to the IL Code. Switch back to C# view and you might be surprised to find your changes aren't exactly maintained in the C# view. The logic is all the same, it is just the layout of our code has moved various pieces about.    
```cs
public int beeType()
{
	if (!this.strongBees || Main.rand.Next(2) != 0)
	{
		this.makeStrongBee = false;
		return 181;
	}
	this.makeStrongBee = true;
	if (this.GetModPlayer<ExamplePlayer>().strongBeesUpgrade && Main.rand.NextBool(10))
	{
		return 183;
	}
	return 566;
}
```    
Do not worry, however, as our approach for this patch is to find the `return 566` in the instructions and add our instructions right before that. This can still be done even though the instructions have moved around a little in our temporarily modified copy of the instructions. Switching back to the IL view, lets find the code between `this.makeStrongBee = true;` and `return 566`. This code now contains the instructions for our if statement and returning 183. Lets annotate these instructions now:    
```cs
// push Player instance onto stack
IL_0015: ldarg.0
// push 1 or true onto stack
IL_0016: ldc.i4.1
// set Player.makeStrongBee
IL_0017: stfld     bool Terraria.Player::makeStrongBee

// NEW: push Player instance onto stack
IL_001C: ldarg.0
// NEW: Calls GetModPlayer
IL_001D: call      instance !!0 Terraria.Player::GetModPlayer<class [ExampleMod]ExampleMod.ExamplePlayer>()
// NEW: place the value of strongBeesUpgrade onto the stack
IL_0022: ldfld     bool [ExampleMod]ExampleMod.ExamplePlayer::strongBeesUpgrade
// NEW: If result is false, jump to instruction 3D. (short-circuiting)
IL_0027: brfalse.s IL_003D

// NEW: push Main.rand onto stack
IL_0029: ldsfld    class Terraria.Utilities.UnifiedRandom Terraria.Main::rand
// NEW: push 10 onto stack
IL_002E: ldc.i4.s  10
// NEW: Call Utils.NextBool. Why Utils? Utils is the class that defines the NextBool extension method!
IL_0030: call      bool Terraria.Utils::NextBool(class Terraria.Utilities.UnifiedRandom, int32)
// NEW: If result is false, jump to instruction 3D.
IL_0035: brfalse.s IL_003D

// NEW: Push 183, aka Beenade, onto stack
IL_0037: ldc.i4    183
// NEW: Return taking Beenade with it
IL_003C: ret

// Push 566, aka GiantBee, onto stack
IL_003D: ldc.i4    566
// Return taking GiantBee with it
IL_0042: ret
```
By annotating the new IL code, we can see that our logic is neatly contained all before the original `return 566` code. Now lets work on the patch code. Finally!    

## Patch Code
Since this IL editing will be fairly straightforward, we will detail 3 separate approaches to this patch. Hopefully the repetition will give insight into different ways to approach IL editing. The full code can be explored on [WaspNest.cs](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/blob/master/ExampleMod/Items/Accessories/WaspNest.cs).

### Common Ideas
The first concept to explore is loading our patch. Since this patch pertains to a new ModItem in our mod, lets add the patch to `ModItem.Autoload`. Simply override `Autoload` and type `IL.Terraria.Player.beeType += HookBeeType;` and then allow Visual Studio to generate the HookBeeType method for us. If Visual Studio doesn't understand the `IL.Terraria` namespace, make sure to add a dll reference to the MonoMod and TerrariaHooks dlls found in `Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\references`. 

Next, we begin writing code. To start, we create a Cursor by writing `var c = new ILCursor(il);`. A Cursor allows us to navigate the IL codes in a well organized manner. We need to use Cursor methods such as `TryGotoNext` and `GotoLabel` to navigate to the correct index within the list of IL instructions. We can't rely on hard-coded indexes because we need our patch to work properly when multiple patches edit the same method, or when different builds of tModLoader slightly change the IL instructions. Designing robust patch code is expected, as this is an Expert level technique. 

After creating a cursor, we need to advance the cursor to be pointing at the area of code we desire to edit. As we have discovered through compiling in dnSpy, we want to insert our code between the code that sets `makeStrongBee` to true and the code that returns 566. We can write `if (!c.TryGotoNext(i => i.MatchLdcI4(566)))` to advance the cursor to the next IL instructions that matches the OpCode of `ldc.i4` with the operand of `566`. If such an instruction is not found, we would want to exit our patch and possibly log our patch failure to the logs, otherwise, we continue onto our edits in any of the following approaches.

### Approach 1 - Modifying Evaluation Stack
This first approach is the simplest. In this approach, we can take advantage of the fact that while `return 566;` is a single line in c#, in IL instructions, it consists of 2 instructions, the first pushing 566 to the stack, and the 2nd returning from the method. By taking advantage of this, we can insert instructions in between those 2 instructions to achieve our desired behavior. In effect, we are changing `return 566;` to `return (this.GetModPlayer<ExamplePlayer>().strongBeesUpgrade && Main.rand.NextBool(10)) ? 183 : 566;`. The first line of code here moves the cursor down: `c.Index++;`. The cursor was pointing at the instruction pushing 566 to the stack earlier, so increasing the index places the cursor right on the ret OpCode. After this, we call `.Emit` on the cursor with an OpCode, which places the specified OpCode at the current cursor index and pushes all the other instructions down, similar to List.Insert. The instruction we provide is Ldarg_0, which will push the current Player instance onto the stack because this is a non-static method. At this point, the stack consists of the Player at the top and an int with the original return value below that.     
With an int and Player on the stack, we can now use `.EmitDelegate` to write c# code for the rest of our patch, greatly simplifying things. The generic types provided to the Delegate need to match up with the current stack, in order from bottom to top (oldest to most recently pushed). In this case, we will be using a `Func` which takes 2 parameters and returns 1 parameter. The 2 input parameters must be `int` and `Player` as those match the current stack. The output type will be `int` because it will go onto the stack after the int and Player are popped off. When our patch began, there was an int on the stack, so we need to make sure the stack is still the same when our patch completes so we don't crash the game. In our delegate, we simply put our conditional and use the provided original return value and Player instance to drive our logic. Here is the complete code:
```cs
// Start the Cursor at the start
var c = il.At(0);
// Try to find where 566 is placed onto the stack
if (!c.TryGotoNext(i => i.MatchLdcI4(566)))
	return; // Patch unable to be applied

// Move the cursor after 566 and onto the ret op.
c.Index++; 
// Push the Player instance onto the stack
c.Emit(Mono.Cecil.Cil.OpCodes.Ldarg_0);
// Call a delegate using the int and Player from the stack.
c.EmitDelegate<Func<int, Player, int>>((returnValue, player) =>
{
	// Regular c# code
	if (player.GetModPlayer<ExamplePlayer>().strongBeesUpgrade && Main.rand.NextBool(10) && Main.ProjectileUpdateLoopIndex == -1)
		return ProjectileID.Beenade;
	return returnValue;
});
// After the delegate, the stack will once again have an int and the ret instruction will return from this method
```

### Approach 2 - Labels and Branches
This next approach is very similar to approach 1, but aims to show how branching works via labels. If you remember from our exploration of the IL code above, IL instructions often use the `brfalse` OpCodes to conditionally jump to different instructions. When we make if statements in c#, the compiler implements those as jumps to different areas of code. With IL editing, we can define Labels that our branching code can jump to. The code is below. We can see that in effect, this approach more similarly matches the typical c# code approach by more closely mimicking the behavior of an if statement inserted before `return 566;` in the original code. While this is a simple example, using labels and branching may prove a useful skill.
```cs
// Make a label to use later
var label = il.DefineLabel();
// Push the Player instance onto the stack
c.Emit(Mono.Cecil.Cil.OpCodes.Ldarg_0);
// Call a delegate popping the Player from the stack and pushing a bool
c.EmitDelegate<Func<Player, bool>>(player => player.GetModPlayer<ExamplePlayer>().strongBeesUpgrade && Main.rand.NextBool(10) && Main.ProjectileUpdateLoopIndex == -1);
// if the bool on the stack is false, jump to label
c.Emit(Mono.Cecil.Cil.OpCodes.Brfalse, label);
// Otherwise, push ProjectileID.Beenade and return
c.Emit(Mono.Cecil.Cil.OpCodes.Ldc_I4, ProjectileID.Beenade);
c.Emit(Mono.Cecil.Cil.OpCodes.Ret);
// Set the label to the current cursor, which is still the instruction pushing 566 (which is followed by Ret)
c.MarkLabel(label);
```

### Approach 3 - Direct OpCode
This final approach finally uses the output straight from dnSpy that we generated earlier. Seeing that our changes in the c# code of the method were neatly contained in a block of IL instructions nested between setting makeStrongBee to true and returning 566, we can simply insert those new instructions between those instructions directly. To do this, we take the output of dnSpy and line by line replace each instruction with equivalent patch code. For example, for `IL_001C: ldarg.0`, we can write `c.Emit(Mono.Cecil.Cil.OpCodes.Ldarg_0);`. We can use `using static Mono.Cecil.Cil.OpCodes;` to slim down the code to `c.Emit(Ldarg_0);`. We still need to generate new labels for the branch instructions, and we need to be aware of the expected values and cast appropriately. For example, to convert `IL_002E: ldc.i4.s  10` to code, we need to read the documentation and see that the `ldc.i4.s` OpCode expects an int8, which is an sbyte. The code would be `c.Emit(Ldc_I4_S, (sbyte)10);`, failure to cast correctly will crash the game.    
The next thing to be aware of is that you need to pass in MethodInfo and FieldInfo classes rather than calling the method or field directly. For example, to adapt `IL_0037: ldsfld    int32 Terraria.Main::ProjectileUpdateLoopIndex`, you might make the mistake of writing `c.Emit(Ldsfld, Main.ProjectileUpdateLoopIndex);`, but that won't work. You need to use regular reflection techniques to retrieve a FieldInfo, like this: `c.Emit(Ldsfld, typeof(Main).GetField(nameof(Main.ProjectileUpdateLoopIndex)));`. Note that using `nameof` helps avoid spelling mistakes. This example will also shot how to retrieve a generic version of a MethodInfo.    
Having converted all the IL instructions to patch code, making labels, and applying those labels to the instructions that need it, our patch is complete. This direct approach is useful if you don't quite understand how the stack works and are willing to write a bit more tedious code.    
```cs
var label = il.DefineLabel(); // Make a label that will point to the instruction pushing 566 to the stack

c.Emit(Ldarg_0);
c.Emit(Call, typeof(Player).GetMethod("GetModPlayer", new Type[] { }).MakeGenericMethod(typeof(ExamplePlayer)));
c.Emit(Ldfld, typeof(ExamplePlayer).GetField(nameof(ExamplePlayer.strongBeesUpgrade)));
c.Emit(Brfalse_S, label);
c.Emit(Ldsfld, typeof(Main).GetField(nameof(Main.rand)));
c.Emit(Ldc_I4_S, (sbyte)10);
c.Emit(Call, typeof(Utils).GetMethod("NextBool", new Type[] { typeof(Terraria.Utilities.UnifiedRandom), typeof(int) }));
c.Emit(Brfalse_S, label);
c.Emit(Ldsfld, typeof(Main).GetField(nameof(Main.ProjectileUpdateLoopIndex)));
c.Emit(Ldc_I4_M1);
c.Emit(Bne_Un_S, label);
c.Emit(Ldc_I4, ProjectileID.Beenade);
c.Emit(Ret);

c.MarkLabel(label); // The cursor is still pointing to the ldc.i4 566 instruction, this label gives the branch instructions a destination
```

# Example - Lava Snail Statue Spawn
See [ExampleCritter.cs](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/blob/master/ExampleMod/NPCs/ExampleCritter.cs) for another IL editing patch example. This example is much trickier as the method we want to patch is very large. The example is well commented and shows a more complex example of instruction targeting.

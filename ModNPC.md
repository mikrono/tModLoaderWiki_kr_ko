# ModNPC

This class serves as a place for you to place all your properties and hooks for each NPC. Create instances of ModNPC (preferably overriding this class) to pass as parameters to Mod.AddNPC.

## Properties

### public NPC npc

The NPC object that this ModNPC controls.

### public Mod mod

The mod that added this ModNPC.

### public virtual bool CloneNewInstances

Whether instances of this ModNPC are created through a memberwise clone or its constructor. Defaults to false.

## Fields

### public int aiType

Determines which type of vanilla NPC this ModNPC will copy the behavior (AI) of. Leave as 0 to not copy any behavior. Defaults to 0.

### public int animationType

Determines which type of vanilla NPC this ModNPC will copy the animation (FindFrame) of. Leave as 0 to not copy any animation. Defaults to 0.

### public int bossBag

The item type of the boss bag that is dropped when DropBossBags is called for this NPC.

### public int music

The ID of the music that plays when this NPC is on or near the screen. Defaults to -1, which means music plays normally.

### public float drawOffsetY

The vertical offset used for drawing this NPC. Defaults to 0.

### public int banner

The type of NPC that this NPC will be considered as when determining banner drops and banner bonuses. By default this will be 0, which means this NPC is not associated with any banner. To give your NPC its own banner, set this field to the NPC's type.

### public int bannerItem

The type of the item this NPC drops for every 50 times it is defeated. For any ModNPC whose banner field is set to the type of this NPC, that ModNPC will drop this banner.

## Methods

### public virtual bool Autoload(ref string name, ref string texture)

Allows you to automatically load an NPC instead of using Mod.AddNPC. Return true to allow autoloading; by default returns the mod's autoload property. Name is initialized to the overriding class name, and texture is initialized to the namespace and overriding class name with periods replaced with slashes. Use this method to either force or stop an autoload, or to change the default display name and texture path.

### public virtual void AutoloadHead(ref string headTexture, ref string bossHeadTexture)

Allows you to control the path to this NPC's head texture when it is autoloaded. The headTexture defaults to the default NPC texture plus "_Head", and the bossHeadTexture defaults to the default headTexture plus "_Head_Boss". If the textures don't exist, the NPC will not be given a head texture. The headTexture should be used for town NPCs, and the bossHeadTexture should be used for any non-town NPC that you want to display on the map.

### public virtual void SetDefaults()

Allows you to set all your NPC's properties, such as width, damage, aiStyle, lifeMax, etc.

### public virtual void ScaleExpertStats(int numPlayers, float bossLifeScale)

Allows you to customize this NPC's stats in expert mode. This is useful because expert mode's doubling of damage and life might be too much sometimes (for example, with bosses). Also useful for scaling life with the number of players in the world.

### public virtual void ResetEffects()

This is where you reset any fields you add to your subclass to their default states. This is necessary in order to reset your fields if they are conditionally set by a tick update but the condition is no longer satisfied. (Note: This hook is only really useful for GlobalNPC, but is included in ModNPC for completion.)

### public virtual bool PreAI()

Allows you to determine how this NPC behaves. Return false to stop the vanilla AI and the AI hook from being run. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void AI()

Allows you to determine how this NPC behaves. This will only be called if PreAI returns true.

### public virtual void PostAI()

Allows you to determine how this NPC behaves. This will be called regardless of what PreAI returns.

### public virtual void SendExtraAI(BinaryWriter writer)

If you are storing AI information outside of the npc.ai array, use this to send that AI information between clients and servers.

### public virtual void ReceiveExtraAI(BinaryReader reader)

Use this to receive information that was sent in SendExtraAI.

### public virtual void FindFrame(int frameHeight)

Allows you to modify the frame from this NPC's texture that is drawn, which is necessary in order to animate NPCs.

### public virtual void HitEffect(int hitDirection, double damage)

Allows you to make things happen whenever this NPC is hit, such as creating dust or gores.

### public virtual void UpdateLifeRegen(ref int damage)

Allows you to make the NPC either regenerate health or take damage over time by setting npc.lifeRegen. Regeneration or damage will occur at a rate of half of npc.lifeRegen per second. The damage parameter is the number that appears above the NPC's head if it takes damage over time.

### public virtual bool CheckActive()

Whether or not to run the code for checking whether this NPC will remain active. Return false to stop this NPC from being despawned and to stop this NPC from counting towards the limit for how many NPCs can exist near a player. Returns true by default.

### public virtual bool CheckDead()

Whether or not this NPC should be killed when it reaches 0 health. You may program extra effects in this hook (for example, how Golem's head lifts up for the second phase of its fight). Return false to stop this NPC from being killed. Returns true by default.

### public virtual bool PreNPCLoot()

Allows you to determine whether or not this NPC will drop anything at all. Return false to stop the NPC from dropping anything. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void NPCLoot()

### public virtual bool? DrawHealthBar(byte hbPosition, ref float scale, ref Vector2 position)

Allows you to control how the health bar for this NPC is drawn. The hbPosition parameter is the same as Main.hbPosition; it determines whether the health bar gets drawn above or below the NPC by default. The scale parameter is the health bar's size. By default, it will be the normal 1f; most bosses set this to 1.5f. Return null to let the normal vanilla health-bar-drawing code to run. Return false to stop the health bar from being drawn. Return true to draw the health bar in the position specified by the position parameter (note that this is the world position, not screen position).

### public virtual float CanSpawn(NPCSpawnInfo spawnInfo)

Whether or not this NPC can spawn with the given spawning conditions. Return the weight for the chance of this NPC to spawn compared to vanilla mobs. All vanilla mobs combined have a total weight of 1. Returns 0 by default, which disables natural spawning.

### public virtual int SpawnNPC(int tileX, int tileY)

### public virtual void TownNPCAttackProjSpeed(ref float multiplier, ref float gravityCorrection, ref float randomOffset)

Allows you to determine the speed at which this town NPC throws a projectile when it attacks. Multiplier is the speed of the projectile, gravityCorrection is how much extra the projectile gets thrown upwards, and randomOffset allows you to randomize the projectile's velocity in a square centered around the original velocity. This hook is only used when the town NPC has an attack type of 0 (throwing), 1 (shooting), or 2 (magic).

### public virtual void TownNPCAttackShoot(ref bool inBetweenShots)

Allows you to tell the game that this town NPC has already created a projectile and will still create more projectiles as part of a single attack so that the game can animate the NPC's attack properly. Only used when the town NPC has an attack type of 1 (shooting).

### public virtual void TownNPCAttackMagic(ref float auraLightMultiplier)

### public virtual void TownNPCAttackSwing(ref int itemWidth, ref int itemHeight)

Allows you to determine the width and height of the item this town NPC swings when it attacks, which controls the range of this NPC's swung weapon. Only used when the town NPC has an attack type of 3 (swinging).

### public virtual void DrawTownAttackGun(ref float scale, ref int item, ref int closeness)

Allows you to customize how this town NPC's weapon is drawn when this NPC is shooting (this NPC must have an attack type of 1). Scale is a multiplier for the item's drawing size, item is the ID of the item to be drawn, and closeness is how close the item should be drawn to the NPC.

### public virtual void DrawTownAttackSwing(ref Texture2D item, ref int itemSize, ref float scale, ref Vector2 offset)

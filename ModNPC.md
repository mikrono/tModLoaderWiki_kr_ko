This class serves as a place for you to place all your properties and hooks for each NPC. Create instances of ModNPC (preferably overriding this class) to pass as parameters to Mod.AddNPC.

## Properties

### public NPC npc

The NPC object that this ModNPC controls.

### public Mod mod

The mod that added this ModNPC.

## Fields

### public int aiType

### public int animationType

Determines which type of vanilla NPC this ModNPC will copy the animation (FindFrame) of. Leave as 0 to not copy any animation. Defaults to 0.

The item type of the boss bag that is dropped when DropBossBags is called for this NPC.

## Methods

### public virtual bool Autoload(ref string name, ref string texture)

Allows you to automatically load an NPC instead of using Mod.AddNPC. Return true to allow autoloading; by default returns the mod's autoload property. Name is initialized to the overriding class name, and texture is initialized to the namespace and overriding class name with periods replaced with slashes. Use this method to either force or stop an autoload, or to change the default display name and texture path.

Allows you to determine how this NPC behaves. This will only be called if PreAI returns true.

### public virtual void PostAI()

Allows you to determine how this NPC behaves. This will be called regardless of what PreAI returns.

# ModNPC

This class serves as a place for you to place all your properties and hooks for each NPC. Create instances of ModNPC (preferably overriding this class) to pass as parameters to Mod.AddNPC.

## Properties

### public NPC npc

The NPC object that this ModNPC controls.

### public Mod mod

The mod that added this ModNPC.

## Methods

### public virtual bool Autoload(ref string name, ref string texture)

Allows you to automatically load an NPC instead of using Mod.AddNPC. Return true to allow autoloading; by default returns the mod's autoload property. Name is initialized to the overriding class name, and texture is initialized to the namespace and overriding class name with periods replaced with slashes. Use this method to either force or stop an autoload, or to change the default display name and texture path.

### public virtual void SetDefaults()

Allows you to set all your NPC's properties, such as width, damage, aiStyle, lifeMax, etc.

### public virtual bool PreAI()

Allows you to determine how this NPC behaves. Return false to stop the vanilla AI and the AI hook from being run. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void AI()

Allows you to determine how this NPC behaves. This will only be called if PreAI returns true.

### public virtual void PostAI()

Allows you to determine how this NPC behaves. This will be called regardless of what PreAI returns.

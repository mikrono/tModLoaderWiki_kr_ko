# GlobalItem

This class allows you to modify and use hooks for all items, including vanilla items. Create an instance of an overriding class then call Mod.AddGlobalItem to use this.

The name of this GlobalItem instance.

## Methods

Adds a line of text to an item's second group of tooltips.

### public virtual bool Autoload(ref string name)

Allows you to automatically load a GlobalItem instead of using Mod.AddGlobalItem. Return true to allow autoloading; by default returns the mod's autoload property. Name is initialized to the overriding class name. Use this method to either force or stop an autoload or to control the internal name.

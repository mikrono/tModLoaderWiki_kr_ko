# Advanced Prerequisites
Basically all the previous prerequisites. See Beginner and Intermediate prerequisite guides first. 

## tModLoader Source code
You may need to decompile tModLoader to understand the correct way to do something, or to figure out the recommended approach to what you are doing. Anyone attempting to do Advanced level guides probably needs their own copy of decompiled tModLoader.exe. The best way to get this is to download the tModLoader repository and run setup. This will net you a completely functional solution that you can open in Visual Studio. 

A simpler way is to download ilspy, open it up, open up the tModLoader exe in it, and then press the save code button. This will take 20 minutes or so depending on your computer.

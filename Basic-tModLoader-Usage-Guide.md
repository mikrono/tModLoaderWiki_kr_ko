2. Extract the folder you downloaded.

   * If you have java installed on your computer: Run tModLoaderInstaller.jar.
   * If you don't or it didn't work: Follow instructions in ReadMe.txt.
4. Start Terraria as normal, you should see extra menu options.

## GOG Version
See [here](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/tml-gog-patcher-beta.50413/) for installing if your Terraria is the GOG version.

# Installing Mods
Mods are files with the ".tmod" extension. They go in the `Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mods` folder.  
Most mods are hosted in the "Mod Browser". You can easily browse mods and use the download button to download mods. Downloaded mods aren't enabled by default.  
You can also find mods in other places and add them to the Mods folder, this is useful when the Mod Browser is down or the mod is too big for the Mod Browser.  

# Enabling Mods
Use the Mods menu to set the mods you wish to use, then click reload.

# Playing with non-tModLoader users
tModloader will not connect to non-tModLoader Terraria servers
If you would like to play "vanilla" Terraria, you should have a "Terraria v1.3.4.4.exe" in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Terraria`. You can launch this to play vanilla. Make a desktop shortcut if you wish for easy access. Mac/Linux users need to manually rename the .exe files for the time being.

# Server
For the most part, launching a tModLoader server is the exact same as launching a Terraia server.

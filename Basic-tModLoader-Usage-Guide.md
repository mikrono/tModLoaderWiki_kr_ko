If you run into problems, see the [Usage FAQ](https://github.com/bluemagic123/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-FAQ)  

# Installing tModLoader
1. Download the latest tModLoader: [Download Page](https://github.com/bluemagic123/tModLoader/releases/latest)
2. Extract the folder you downloaded.
3. Install: 
   * If you have java installed on your computer, **AND** you have Terraria installed in the _**default**_ directory: Run tModLoaderInstaller.jar.
   * If you don't or it didn't work: Follow instructions in ReadMe.txt.
4. Start Terraria as normal, you should see extra menu options.

## GOG Version
See [here](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/tml-gog-patcher-beta.50413/) for installing if your Terraria is the GOG version. Please note we are not in charge of the GoG patcher, and it may not be up-to-date at all times. The patcher will often be behind in version because Jeckel needs to have time to update the patches.

# Installing Mods
Mods are files with the ".tmod" extension. They go in the `%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mods` (Windows) folder.  
Most mods are hosted in the "Mod Browser". You can easily browse mods and use the download button to download mods. Downloaded mods aren't enabled by default.  
You can also find mods in other places and add them to the Mods folder, this is useful when the Mod Browser is down or the mod is too big for the Mod Browser.  

# Enabling Mods
Use the Mods menu to set the mods you wish to use, then click reload.

# Playing with non-tModLoader users
tModloader will not connect to non-tModLoader Terraria servers
If you would like to play "vanilla" Terraria, you should have a "Terraria v1.3.5.3.exe" in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Terraria` (The path can be different depending on where you installed Terraria) You can launch this to play vanilla. Make a desktop shortcut if you wish for easy access. Mac/Linux users need to manually rename the .exe files for the time being.

# Server
For the most part, launching a tModLoader server is the exact same as launching a Terraia server.

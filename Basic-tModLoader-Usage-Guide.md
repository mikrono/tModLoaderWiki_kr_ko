# Installing tModLoader
[Read our install instructions](tModLoader-guide-for-players)

# Installing Mods
- Mods are files with the ".tmod" extension. They go in the Mods directory.
  - Windows: `%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mods`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/Terraria/ModLoader/Mods` OR `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Terraria`
  - Mac: `/Users/account/Library/Application Support/Terraria`
- **Most mods are hosted in the "Mod Browser". You can easily browse mods and use the download button to download mods. Downloaded mods aren't enabled by default.**
- If you use the Steam version, you can also get mods from the Steam Workshop **when it is available.**
- You can also find mods in other places and add them to the Mods folder, this is useful when the Mod Browser is down or the mod is too big for the Mod Browser.  

# Enabling Mods
Use the Mods menu to set the mods you wish to use, then click reload.

# Playing with non-tModLoader users
**tModloader will not connect to non-tModLoader Terraria servers.**
If you want to play together, you must either revert to vanilla, or your friends must install tModLoader.

You can learn more about running a modded server [here](Starting-a-modded-server).

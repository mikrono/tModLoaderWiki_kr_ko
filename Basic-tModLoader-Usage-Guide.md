- **Learn the basics of using tModLoader for both players and modders**
- If you run into problems, see the [Usage FAQ](https://github.com/bluemagic123/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-FAQ)  

# Installing tModLoader
1. Download the latest tModLoader: [Download Page](https://github.com/bluemagic123/tModLoader/releases/latest)
2. Extract the folder you downloaded.
3. Install: 
   * Do not run the installer.jar file, follow the instructions in readme.txt
4. Start Terraria as normal, you should see extra menu options.

## GoG Version
**Note: Jeckel, the author and maintainer of the GoG patcher, has not been seen for a very long time. The GoG is out of date and likely does not work correctly. There is no official alternative, for now.**

See [here](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/tml-gog-patcher-beta.50413/) for installing if your Terraria is the GOG version. Please note we are not in charge of the GoG patcher, and it may not be up-to-date at all times. The patcher will often be behind in version because Jeckel needs to have time to update the patches.

# Installing Mods
- Mods are files with the ".tmod" extension. They go in the `%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mods` (Windows) folder.  
- Most mods are hosted in the "Mod Browser". You can easily browse mods and use the download button to download mods. Downloaded mods aren't enabled by default.  
- You can also find mods in other places and add them to the Mods folder, this is useful when the Mod Browser is down or the mod is too big for the Mod Browser.  

# Enabling Mods
Use the Mods menu to set the mods you wish to use, then click reload.

# Playing with non-tModLoader users
**tModloader will not connect to non-tModLoader Terraria servers.**
If you want to player together you must either revert to vanilla or your friends must install tModLoader.

You can learn more about running a modded server [here](Starting-a-modded-server).

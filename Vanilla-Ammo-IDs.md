The following is a list of constants found in the `Terraria.ID.AmmoID` class.

`AmmoID`s are used to define ammo classes, groups of items that all work with the same weapons. `AmmoID`s are based off of the `ItemID` of the first ammo item in that class. For example, the `ItemID` `MusketBall` has a value of 97 and the AmmoID for Bullet also has a value of 97. All other Bullets in the game set their `item.ammo` to `AmmoID.Bullet`, and all weapons that use Bullet ammo set their `item.useAmmo` to `AmmoID.Bullet`. For ModItems, please follow this numbering convention as well to avoid ID overlap.

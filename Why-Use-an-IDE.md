# Why Use an IDE
This page will hopefully convince you to abandon making mods in Notepad. Be sure to click the links below to watch the videos. All info presented corresponds to Visual Studio, but other IDEs have similar functionality.

# Syntax Error Checking    
When you make a syntax error, you'll see red underlines under the bad code, similar to a spell check.

Seeing the explanation above, we can fix the code easily by changing `20.5f` to just `20`.

## Show Potential Fixes
Sometimes Visual Studio can guess how to fix your error. For example, below we forget to add `using Terraria.ID;` to our ModItem class.

Clicking `Show potential fixes` or pressing the hotkey shows the following options.

Clicking the first option adds the appropriate using statement to our code. We can fix errors without trying to build in-game.

# GlobalTile

This class allows you to modify the behavior of any tile in the game. Create an instance of an overriding class then call Mod.SetGlobalTile to use this.

## Properties

### public Mod mod

The mod to which this GlobalTile belongs to.

## Methods

### public void AddToArray(ref int[] array, int type)

A convenient method for adding an integer to the end of an array. This can be used with the arrays in TileID.Sets.RoomNeeds.

### public virtual void SetDefaults()

Allows you to modify the properties of any tile in the game. Most properties are stored as arrays throughout the Terraria code.

### public virtual bool KillSound(int i, int j, int type)

Allows you to customize which sound you want to play when the tile at the given coordinates is hit. Return false to stop the game from playing its default sound for the tile. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void NumDust(int i, int j, int type, ref int num)

Allows you to change how many dust particles are created when the tile at the given coordinates is hit.

### public virtual bool CreateDust(int i, int j, int type, ref int dustType)

Allows you to modify the default type of dust created when the tile at the given coordinates is hit. Return false to stop the default dust (the dustType parameter) from being created. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void DropCritterChance(int i, int j, int type, ref int wormChance, ref int grassHopperChance, ref int jungleGrubChance)

Allows you to modify the chance the tile at the given coordinates has of spawning a certain critter when the tile is killed.

### public virtual bool Drop(int i, int j, int type)

Allows you to customize which items the tile at the given coordinates drops. Return false to stop the game from dropping the tile's default item. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void KillTile(int i, int j, int type, ref bool fail, ref bool effectOnly, ref bool noItem)

Allows you to determine what happens when the tile at the given coordinates is killed or hit with a pickaxe. Fail determines whether the tile is mined, effectOnly makes it so that only dust is created, and noItem stops items from dropping.

### public virtual void ModifyLight(int i, int j, int type, ref float r, ref float g, ref float b)

Allows you to determine how much light the block emits. Make sure you set Main.tileLighted[type] to true in SetDefaults for this to work.

### public virtual void SetSpriteEffects(int i, int j, int type, ref SpriteEffects spriteEffects)

Allows you to determine whether or not a tile will draw itself flipped in the world.

### public virtual bool PreDraw(int i, int j, int type, SpriteBatch spriteBatch)

Allows you to draw things behind the tile at the given coordinates. Return false to stop the game from drawing the tile normally. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void PostDraw(int i, int j, int type, SpriteBatch spriteBatch)

Allows you to draw things in front of the tile at the given coordinates. This can also be used to do things such as creating dust.

### public virtual void RandomUpdate(int i, int j, int type)

Called for every tile the world randomly decides to update in a given tick. Useful for things such as growing or spreading.

### public virtual bool TileFrame(int i, int j, int type, ref bool resetFrame, ref bool noBreak)

Called for every tile that updates due to being placed or being next to a tile that is changed. Return false to stop the game from carrying out its default TileFrame operations. Returns true by default.

The following is a list of Open Source Mods (not all are technically "Open Source" in the traditional sense, by the way.). These mods' sources are available for a variety of reasons, mostly to facilitate and encourage community contributions, but we have listed them here for two reasons. 

1. The first reason is that modding is difficult, and learning how to do everything by oneself can prove hard. Joining an existing mod is a great way to quickly see your ideas come to life without having to know everything about Terraria modding. If you are interested in contributing to one of these mods, feel free to fork the mod, make your changes, and then submit a pull request to the main branch. Once you have gained the trust of the mod owner, you may be allowed into the team and given direct access to the mod. Please note that not all open source mods desire random contributions. Try to get a feel for what the mod needs, either by noticing bug reports on their Issue tracker or on their homepage. You can also look for `TODO` notes in the code or noted elsewhere for ideas of things to implement. If you are contributing art or sounds, it might be a good idea to communicate with the mod owner as well to get art direction before you waste your efforts on something that wasn't desired. If in doubt, contact the mod owner on the Terraria Community Forums.

2. The second reason we have listed these mods is because there are still a lot of things the tutorials and ExampleMod do not cover. Search these mods and look for code that might help you. Remember, just because a Mod is Open Source, that doesn't mean you can copy all the code and call it your own. Read the licence the code is licenced under for details. For the most part, however, you should be using Open Source mods as a guide for learning how to structure your mod. (You'll be shunned in the modding community if your mod is just a copy/paste conglomeration of other mods' code.)

**Remember, you can't just copy code from these mods unless the licence they are under specifically allows it. If there is no licence, the owner reserves all ownership and copyright of the code, so you need to contact the owner and ask permission to utilize certain parts. Don't worry, most will be happy to allow you to use portions of their code, but you still need to ask.**

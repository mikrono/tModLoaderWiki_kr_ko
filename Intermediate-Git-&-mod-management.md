In this guide we will go over Git, what it is, how it works, and also how we can use Git for our mod source code.

## Foreword
It is important to note that you will be making your source code public (and your mod 'open-source') with this guide. If you do not wish to do so, you probably shouldn't follow along with this guide. (just read it) However, this guide will also explain how Git works so it may still be useful to you. Making your mod open-source comes with many notable benefits, such as:
* Other people will be able to help you, this includes adding new features or content to your mod, as well as fixing bugs or generally improving code
* Get easy feedback using the GitHub issues system, people can make issue threads and provide feedback there
* Your mod will be allowed to be put on the Open-source mods page on the wiki, giving your mod more visibility
For more info, visit the [Open-Source-Mods](Open-Source-Mods) page
* Provide more information using the GitHub wiki system, or even the [GitHub-pages system](https://pages.github.com/)

Most information of this guide has been adapted from [Microsoft](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-git/) and making it available here, because their information is very clear compared to other sites.

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system. Every developer of the project has a working copy of the code and full change history on their local machine. These fully-functional local repositories make it is easy to work offline or remotely. You commit your work locally, and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on the server. This paradigm differs from centralized version control where clients must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of code. Git is the most commonly used version control system.

## The very basics of Git
### Commits
Every time you save your work, Git creates a commit. A commit is a snapshot of all your files at a point in time. If a file has not changed from one commit to the next, Git uses the previously stored file. This design differs from other systems which store an initial version of a file and keep a record of deltas over time.

Commits create links to other commits, forming a graph of your development history . You can revert your code to a previous commit, inspect how files changed from one commit to the next, and review information such as where and when changes were made. Commits are identified in Git by a unique cryptographic hash of the contents of the commit. Because everything is hashed, it is impossible to make changes, lose information, or corrupt files without Git detecting it.

### Branches
Each developer saves changes their own local code repository. As a result, you can have many different changes based off the same commit. Git provides tools for isolating changes and later merging them back together. Branches, which are lightweight pointers to work in progress, manage this separation.  Once your work created in a branch is finished, merge it back into your team’s main (or master) branch.

In this example, 'Some feature' is a feature made on a separate branch which can then later (when finished) be merged back into the master branch. This is useful for developing features of which you are not certain to be included in the final product.

### Staging and file states
Files in Git are in one of three states: modified, staged, or committed. When you first modify a file, the changes exist only in your working directory. They are not yet part of a commit or your development history. You must stage the changed files you want to include in your commit (you can omit files that you wish to commit separately). The staging area contains all changes that you will include in your next commit. Once you’re happy with the staged files, commit them with a message describing what changed. This commit becomes a part of your development history.

Staging lets you pick which file changes to save in a commit so you can break down large changes into a series of smaller commits. When you reduce the scope of your commits, it’s easier to review the commit history to find specific file changes.

# These were the basics of Git...
Now let's move on to some tips when using Git. Further below we will discuss mod management with Git

## Commit frequently
All the time when working on your code you should think about when it is time to make a commit. Remember that your commits are only local as long as you don't push your commits to the public repository. It's a healthy habit to commit as frequently as possible, not just for the sake of management but also the assurance that those specific parts of code changes are saved and now in place in the development history tree.

## Be descriptive, but stay concise
Always make sure your commit names are concise. For example, if you've developed a new feature, just call it 'new feature: name' instead of 'feature name: it can do this, and potentially this and that'. If you want to be descriptive, use the description part of your commit.

## Make use of branches!
Many people are afraid of branches, don't be! They are the most amazing thing ever. Many times, it is useful to use branches even when not for new features specifically. Check the next tip.

## Use branches and pull requests for code review
It is very useful if you make use of the _awesome_ tools Git/GitHub provides you. This is something we often use for tModLoader development, but you can use it as well if you develop your product with multiple people. You can make a new branch and commit your changes to it, then create a new pull request to master from that branch. With  the new pull request, you can ask for feedback and code review from other collaborators!

# Benefits of using Git/GitHub
## Simultaneous development
Everyone has their own local copy of code and can work simultaneously on their own branches. Git works when you’re offline since almost every operation is local. This means Git makes it much and much easier to work on mods with multiple people simultaneously,

## Faster releases
Branches allow for flexible and simultaneous development. The main branch contains stable, high-quality code from which you release. Feature branches contain work in progress, which you merge into the main branch upon completion. By separating your release branch from development in progress, you can manage your stable code better and ship updates more quickly.

## Built-in integration
Due to its popularity, Git is integrated into most tools and products. Every major IDE (like Visual Studio) has built-in Git support, and many tools that allow you to manage continuous integration, continuous deployment, automated testing, work item tracking, metrics, and reporting feature integration with Git. This integration simplifies your day to day workflow.

## Strong community support
Git is open-source and has become the de facto standard for version control, and there is no shortage of tools and resources available for you to leverage. The volume of community support for Git compared to other version control systems makes it easy to get help when you need it.

## Git works with your team
Using Git with a source code management tool can increase your team’s productivity by encouraging collaboration, enforcing policies, automating processes, and improving visibility and traceability of work. You may choose individual tools for version control, work item tracking, and continuous integration and deployment. Or, you can choose a solution like Visual Studio Team Services that lets you manage all of these tasks in one place.

## Pull requests
Use pull requests to discuss code changes with your team before merging them into your main branch. The discussions you have in pull requests are invaluable to ensuring code quality and increase knowledge across your team. Visual Studio Team Services offers a rich pull request experience where you can browse file changes, leave comments, inspect commits, view builds, and vote to approve the code.

## Development policies
Your team can configure Visual Studio Team Services to enforce consistent workflows and process across your team. [Set up branch policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/git/branch-policies) to ensure that pull requests meet your requirements before completion. Branch policies protect your important branches by preventing direct pushes, requiring reviewers, and ensuring clean builds. Use [Issue and Pull Request templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates) for more streamlined issues and PR content.

## Get a free website for your project
GitHub allows you to upload a website for free for your project. Check the [GitHub-pages](https://pages.github.com/) system for more information. For tModLoader we utilize this system by providing source documentation using doxygen: [http://tmodloader.github.io/tModLoader/html/index.html](http://tmodloader.github.io/tModLoader/html/index.html)

## License your work
When you use Git, you can properly license your work. If you have no clue what license to use, check [Choose an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/)

# tModLoader mod management with Git
## Team development
It is common that mods are created by a bunch of people rather than one. Git makes working together on your mod much easier and can provide a more streamlined development process for the team.

## tModLoader GitHub integration
Using GitHub allows you to link your mod to your git repository, you can reap many benefits by doing this. Check the [Mod-Browser (GitHub integration)](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Mod-Browser#github-integration) page for more information.

## Easy release tracking
With Git, it becomes much easier to track your releases of your mod. If you use Git from the start, you will be able to go back to any release you ever made and check out the code you had at that time. Useful for mods that live for a long time.

The following is a list of the names of the world generation steps in order. Use these names to select world generation steps to either remove or position custom world generation steps while utilizing ModWorld.ModifyWorldGenTasks

**Don't count the steps and use that hard-coded index to modify world generation, other mods that execute before your mod might have already modified the list and the index could be off.**

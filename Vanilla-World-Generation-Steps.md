The following is a list of the names of the world generation steps in order. Use these names to select world generation steps to either remove or position custom world generation steps while utilizing `ModSystem.ModifyWorldGenTasks()`.

**Don't count the steps and use that hard-coded index to modify world generation, other mods that execute before your mod might have already modified the list and the index could be off.**

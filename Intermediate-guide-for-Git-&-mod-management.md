In this guide we will go over Git, what it is, how it works, and also how we can use Git for our mod source code.

## Foreword
It is important to note that you will be making your source code public (and your mod 'open-source') with this guide. If you do not wish to do so, you probably shouldn't follow along with this guide. (just read it) However, this guide will also explain how Git works so it may still be useful to you. Making your mod open-source comes with many notable benefits, such as:
* Other people will be able to help you, this includes adding new features or content to your mod, as well as fixing bugs or generally improving code
* Get easy feedback using the GitHub issues system, people can make issue threads and provide feedback there
* Your mod will be allowed to be put on the Open-source mods page on the wiki, giving your mod more visibility
For more info, visit the [Open-Source-Mods](Open-Source-Mods) page
* Provide more information using the GitHub wiki system, or even the [GitHub-pages system](https://pages.github.com/)

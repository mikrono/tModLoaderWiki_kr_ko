## Methods

### public virtual bool Autoload(ref string name, ref string texture)

Allows you to set the properties of this wall. Many properties are stored as arrays throughout Terraria's code.

### public virtual bool KillSound(int i, int j)

Allows you to customize which sound you want to play when the wall at the given coordinates is hit. Return false to stop the game from playing its default sound for the wall. Returns true by default.

### public virtual void NumDust(int i, int j, bool fail, ref int num)

Allows you to change how many dust particles are created when the wall at the given coordinates is hit.

### public virtual bool CreateDust(int i, int j, ref int type)

Allows you to modify the default type of dust created when the wall at the given coordinates is hit. Return false to stop the default dust (the type parameter) from being created. Returns true by default.

### public virtual bool Drop(int i, int j, ref int type)

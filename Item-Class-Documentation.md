# Fields and Properties
You can assign these fields to give your ModItem various values. Typically you'll want to refer to this page when writing code for ModItem.SetDefaults.

## value (int)
Value is the number of copper coins the item is worth (aka, cost to buy from a merchant). Setting it to 10462 would mean the item cost 1 gold, 4 silver, and 62 copper. The sell price of an item is one fifth of its value. Value also influences reforge costs with the goblin tinkerer. For convenience, you can also use the `Item.buyPrice()` method for setting values: `item.value = Item.buyPrice(0, 1, 4, 62);`
You can also use the `Item.sellPrice()` method if you would rather think about an items value the other way.  Both `Item.buyPrice(0, 0, 10, 55)` and `Item.sellPrice(0, 0, 2, 11)` would set the value to 1055.

## useStyle (int)
The use style of your item:   
1 for swinging,

# Methods
Remember that static methods are called by writing the classname and non-static methods use the instance name. `Item.NewItem(...)` vs `item.CloneDefaults(...)`
### public static int NewItem(int X, int Y, int Width, int Height, int Type, int Stack = 1, bool noBroadcast = false, int pfix = 0, bool noGrabDelay = false, bool reverseLookup = false)
Spawns an item in the world. Commonly seen used in ModNPC.NPCLoot. X, Y, Width, and Height are commonly derived from the npc. 
Example: `Item.NewItem((int)npc.position.X, (int)npc.position.Y, npc.width, npc.height, mod.ItemType("ExampleItem"));`

### public static int NewItem(Rectangle rectangle, int Type, int Stack = 1, bool noBroadcast = false, int prefixGiven = 0, bool noGrabDelay = false, bool reverseLookup = false)
This alternate method signature can simplify code.  
Example: `Item.NewItem(npc.getRect(), mod.ItemType("ExampleItem"));`

## tModLoader Only
### public ItemInfo GetModInfo(Mod mod, string name)

Gets the ItemInfo instance (with the given name and added by the given mod) associated with this item instance.

### public T GetModInfo\<T\>(Mod mod) where T : ItemInfo 

Same as the other GetModInfo, but assumes that the class name and internal name are the same.

### public void CloneDefaults(int type)

Allows you to copy the defaults of a different type of item.
